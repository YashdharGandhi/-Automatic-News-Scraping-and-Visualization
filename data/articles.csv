International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds has resigned over the prime minister's cuts to the aid budget. In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Dodds said the cuts to international aid, announced earlier this week to fund an increase in defence spending, would ""remove food and healthcare from desperate people - deeply harming the UK's reputation"". She told the PM she had delayed her resignation until after his meeting with President Trump, saying it was ""imperative that you had a united cabinet behind you as you set off for Washington"". The Oxford East MP, who attended cabinet despite not being a cabinet minister, said it was with ""sadness"" that she was resigning.

She said that while Sir Keir had been clear he was not ""ideologically opposed"" to international development, the cuts were ""being portrayed as following in President Trump's slipstream of cuts to USAID"". Ahead of his trip to meet the US president, Sir Keir announced aid funding would be reduced from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to fund an increase in defence spending. In his reply to Dodds's resignation letter, the prime minister thanked the departing minister for her ""hard work, deep commitment and friendship"". He said cutting aid was a ""difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly"" adding: ""We will do everything we can...to rebuild a capability on development."" Baroness Chapman of Darlington, formerly a Labour MP, has been appointed to replace Dodds as international development minister.

In her resignation letter, Dodds said she welcomed an increase to defence spending at a time when the post-war global order had ""come crashing down"". She added that she understood some of the increase might have to be paid for by cuts to ODA [overseas development assistance]. However, she expressed disappointment that instead of discussing ""our fiscal rules and approach to taxation"", the prime minister had opted to allow the ODA to ""absorb the entire burden"". She said the cuts would ""likely lead to a UK pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations - at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence"". ""It will likely lead to withdrawal from regional banks and a reduced commitment to the World Bank; the UK being shut out of numerous multilateral bodies; and a reduced voice for the UK in the G7, G20 and in climate negotiations."" The spending cuts mean £6bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. The aid budget is already used to pay for hotels for asylum seekers in the UK, meaning the actual amount spend on aid overseas will be around 0.15% of gross national income.

PA Media Sir Keir's decision to cut aid to fund a boost to defence spending came ahead of a meeting with the US president.

The prime minister's decision to increase defence spending came ahead of his meeting in Washington - the US president has been critical of European countries for not spending enough on defence and instead relying on American military support. He welcomed the UK's commitment to spend more, but Sir Keir has been attacked by international development charities and some of his own MPs for the move. Dodds held off her announcement until the prime minister's return from Washington, in order not to overshadow the crucial visit, and it was clear she did not want to make things difficult for the prime minister. But other MPs have been uneasy about the decision, including Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the international development committee, who said that cutting the aid budget to fund defence spending is a false economy that would ""only make the world less safe"". Labour MP Diane Abbott, who had been critical of the cuts earlier in the week, said it was ""shameful"" that other ministers had not resigned along with Dodds. Dodds's resignation also highlights that decisions the prime minister feels he has to take will be at odds with some of the views of Labour MPs, and those will add to tensions between the leadership and backbenchers."

Pope Francis, who has been battling pneumonia for two weeks, has had an ""isolated"" breathing crisis in hospital, the Vatican has said. It led to an episode of vomiting and a ""sudden worsening of his respiratory condition"" on Friday following the coughing ""bronchospasm"". The 88-year-old's lung's had to be aspirated - cleared of the vomit - and he is now receiving gas through a face mask to help him breathe. Vatican sources say the Pope's doctors need 24-48 hours to determine whether there has been any damage or set back to his condition. For now they are not giving any prognosis. The Pope remains alert and ""in good spirits"", the sources say.

In a statement the Vatican said: ""In the early afternoon of today, after a morning spent alternating respiratory physiotherapy with prayer in the chapel, the Holy Father presented an isolated crisis of bronchospasm which, however, led to an episode of vomiting with inhalation and sudden worsening of the respiratory condition. ""The Holy Father was promptly bronchoaspirated and began non-invasive mechanical ventilation, with a good response to gas exchange."" Vatican sources said the latest crisis happened at around 14:00 local time, but did not say how long it lasted. This latest episode comes after a couple of days in which Vatican statements had been slightly more positive, talking of a ""slight improvement"" in the pontiff's condition. This morning he was given Communion. In an earlier medical update this morning, the Vatican had said the pontiff was showing signs of improvement and would remain in Rome's Gemelli Hospital due to the complex clinical picture. The Pope was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. Then, on 22 February, the Vatican said that the Pope had experienced a respiratory crisis and was in a ""critical"" condition, but later on Sunday released an update saying that he had ""not presented any further respiratory crises"". The following day, the Pope issued a statement asking Catholics to pray for him after he was unable to deliver the traditional Angelus prayer in person for the second week running. But, while the Vatican said the Pope's health is improving, it added that ""further days of clinical stability are necessary to resolve the prognosis""."

Universal Pictures Zendaya will voice new character Felicia, stars alongside Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy

The long-awaited first trailer for the new Shrek 5 film has been criticised by some film fans over the way characters have been animated, giving them different facial features. In the 27-second clip, recurring characters Shrek, Donkey, Pinocchio and Princess Fiona appear alongside Felicia - one of Shrek and Fiona's now grown-up children. The short teaser announces that Zendaya is joining the cast as Felicia, whilst also reintroducing Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy who are all reprising their roles. Oli Hyatt, who runs Blue Zoo Animation, told the BBC there's often ""an instant reaction"" when changes are made to a film like Shrek, due to its ""nostalgic properties"".

Some users on social media have described the changes as ""disrespectful to the original art style"" and ""an AI interpretation of what Shrek 5 could look like"". Others have compared it to the film animation of video game character Sonic the Hedgehog, which Paramount Pictures changed after fan backlash in 2019. Hyatt added: ""The generation of children that watched Shrek back [when it was first released in 2001] are now adults. ""There's usually a feeling of 'this isn't what I knew' or 'I want the old show I remember back'"", he says. Hyatt, whose team contributed to The Adventures of Paddington and Lego City - No Limits, said that ""because the trailer is so short it's hard to tell how its going to look in general"". But, he added: ""You can see from a technical perspective, the advancement in technology. ""That means that on a similar or lower budget, you can producer a higher sheen and render quality, so it doesn't look quite as CGI (computer-generated imagery) and feels more tangible and real"". He doesn't feel like much has changed from the original ""art style"" of Shrek, but says ""the colours, vibrancy and realism"" have changed, which is a symptom of animation technology improving.

Alamy Shrek and Fiona as they were in the original film in 2001

In the short trailer, Shrek (Mike Myers), Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Felicia (Zendaya) gather round a magic mirror to ask ""Who's the fairest of them all?"". The face in the mirror, which also appears to have had a bit of a makeover, responds that it is Shrek, with images then flashed up on screen of Shrek wearing glasses and posing, then dancing in a skintight catsuit before appearing with rippling abdominal muscles. This pays tribute to some of the internet's favourite Shrek memes, whilst giving viewers a first look at the now grown-up Felicia, who first came to life in Shrek The Third in 2007, alongside her triplet siblings Fergus and Farkle. Shrek's return was teased at the end of the Puss In Boots sequel in 2022, so fans have been expecting this new film for quite some time. Its perhaps why the much-loved film has sparked so much pushback, with fans joking that Shrek looks like he's has had ""botox and a face lift"" whilst others have criticised the characters for having rounder faces. But not everyone has a problem with the new looks - some have praised the animators for ageing the characters with greying hair and wrinkles, whilst others say the updated animations are just a symptom of CGI improving.

Police request power to counter misinformation that risk riots,[],,"Police want power to release more details on some cases

Police want the freedom to release more details of some investigations in an effort to prevent misinformation that could result in threats to public safety or national security. In a submission to a review of contempt of court laws, three national policing bodies have said that they should be allowed to say more when a ""tipping point"" is reached and accusations of a cover-up could result in violence. It follows the Southport knife attack in July, when misinformation about the attacker snowballed on social media, which Merseyside Police did not initially counter, leading to riots across the UK. Current laws prevent certain details in ongoing criminal cases being published before a trial, so that it does not prejudice the jury.

Merseyside Police was criticised for not giving early details of Axel Rudakubana, the man later convicted of the murders of three young girls in Southport, when posts on social media falsely suggested he was an asylum seeker and potentially an Islamist extremist. The early police communications strategy was based on advice from prosecutors, the force's chief previously said. Now, there is a review examining Britain's strict laws on what can be published during an ongoing criminal investigation and how the justice system should respond to breaches. In its submission to the review, the National Police Chiefs' Council, College of Policing and Counter Terrorism Policing said the criminal justice system should reach a ""collective view"" of how to balance the need for a defendant to get a fair trial and the need to maintain public order. ""We would welcome recognition of the role unchecked misinformation and disinformation about high profile criminal incidents, that rightly concern the public, can have in creating a febrile environment where the risks of disorder breaking out is higher,"" the submissions stated. ""We would like the legal framework to acknowledge that this risk exists. ""We do believe there is room to offer stronger reassurance in cases where a tipping point has been reached and where releasing information that could help counter misinformation and disinformation to address public safety risks would be helpful. ""Flexibility is required to mitigate the clear risks to public safety."" The police submission points out that in other countries more information is made public. In August 2024, Austrian police disrupted a plot to attack a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna. They made public: Details of chemical substances and devices found in the main suspect's home

Details of the suspects' nationalities

Details of the suspects' employment

Details of the arrest and that one of the suspects did not resist arrest

A summary of what the suspects had said when interviewed by police, including discussing their plans to kill and that they had uploaded to the internet an oath of allegiance to ISIS

Details of the authorities' views on the suspects' mindset and ideology that had inspired them ""When the public in the UK look at media reporting of cases like this and see that the Austrian public is being given information that policing in this country would say cannot be shared at that stage in order not to prejudice a trial - they have every right to wonder if this is true,"" the submission said."

Skype, the video-calling service that had hundreds of millions of users, is closing in May, its owner Microsoft has said. It was once one of the world's most popular websites and allowed people to make voice calls via their computers to friends and family all over the globe for free. Skype was not the first or only company offering this service but by allowing the public to make computer-to-computer calls free, it helped popularise the concept. In an announcement on X, Skype said users can sign in to Microsoft Teams with their account to stay connected with all their chats and contacts.

Microsoft made no immediate comment when contacted by BBC News. First released in 2003, Skype was bought by the tech giant in 2011 for $8.5bn (£6.1bn) - its biggest-ever acquisition at the time. As Microsoft once outlined, Skype became integrated with the company's other products such as Xbox and Windows devices. In December 2010, tech industry commentator Om Malik called it one of the ""key applications of the modern web"", when the website suffered a two-day global outage.

'It felt like magic'

Following news of its imminent closure, Skype users past and present described their memories of using the service for video calls and the impact it had on their lives. ""My best friend and I share many good memories on Skype,"" one X user said. ""This is a sad day and almost a feeling of losing yet another fragment of my adolescence."" Another early user of Skype called Louise told the BBC she and her partner used the service to chat when they ""embarked on a transatlantic relationship"". ""Skype was such an exciting invention at the time - before smartphones and WhatsApp calls,"" she said. ""It's so easy to assume that we've always been able to freely talk to people across the world but that's such a recent development really."" Anna Simpson, from digital marketing firm Cedarwood Digital, posted on LinkedIn that she would video-call her grandparents on Skype after they moved to France nearly 20 years ago. ""Back then, it felt like magic,"" she wrote. ""There were no dodgy international call charges, just a quick dial-up and some pixelated faces keeping us connected. ""Skype led the way for video calls. But now it's officially done. Microsoft is pulling the plug, but honestly... it's been on life support for years.""

US investigators are trying to establish how Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, died after the discovery of their bodies at their home in the US state of New Mexico. Here is what we know so far about the death of a Hollywood legend known for such films as The French Connection and The Conversation. Warning: this article contains details some readers may find upsetting

How were the deaths discovered?

The bodies of the couple and one of their dogs were found by police on Wednesday at their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, after a maintenance worker called emergency services. In a recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC, the emotional caller can be heard telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies. Hackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen while Arakawa, 65, was found in a bathroom, at the property on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park. The couple appeared to have been ""dead for quite a while"", said Sheriff Adan Mendoza. Arakawa's body showed signs of ""decomposition"", and ""mummification"" in the hands and feet, a sheriff's detective said. Hackman's remains ""showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent"" with those on his spouse. A German Shepherd dog owned by the couple was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Arakawa.

Listen to the 911 call after two bodies found at Hackman residence

What do we know about the cause of death for Hackman and Arakawa?

No cause was given in police statements immediately after the announcement of the deaths. The authorities reported no signs of injury but deemed the deaths ""suspicious enough"" to investigate and did not rule out foul play. Near Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she had abruptly fallen to the ground. Carbon monoxide and toxicology tests have been requested for both Hackman and Arakawa. The local utility company found no sign of a gas leak in the area and the fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant. The warrant suggests police may have a working theory that ""some kind of gas poisoning"" happened but that they do not know yet and are not ruling anything out, Loyola Marymount University law professor Laurie Levenson was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. A prescription bottle and scattered pills lay on the bathroom countertop close to Arakawa's body. Hackman was discovered wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a blue long-sleeve T-shirt and brown slippers. Sunglasses and a walking cane lay next to his body. The detective suspected that the actor had suffered a sudden fall.

Why are the deaths considered suspicious?

The circumstances of their death were deemed ""suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation"", the search warrant says, because the worker who called emergency services had found the front door of the property open. However, the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside. ""There was no indication of a struggle,"" said Sheriff Mendoza. ""There was no indication of anything that was missing from the home or disturbed, you know, that would be indication that there was a crime that had occurred."" Two other, healthy dogs were discovered roaming the property - one inside and one out.

What do we know about the time of their deaths?

All we know is that two maintenance workers, one of whom called the emergency services, say they last had contact with the couple two weeks earlier. The two workers said they had sometimes conducted routine work at the property, but rarely ever saw Hackman and Arakawa. They had communicated with them by phone and text, primarily with Arakawa.

Paris 2024 Olympics: A total of 220 athletes have made requests to replace damaged medals,[],,"A total of 220 requests have been made to replace medals won at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

The medals were designed by French luxury jeweller Chaumet and are set with a piece of iron taken from the Eiffel Tower during its renovation in the 20th Century.

However, British diver Yasmin Harper, who won Team GB's first medal of the Games, was among the athletes to notice her medal was showing signs of ""tarnishing"".

Paris 2024 organisers said any damaged medals will be replaced and the French Mint told AFP it has received 220 such requests - equivalent to four percent of the total awarded.

""The French Mint [Monnaie de Paris] has replaced some of them and is continuing its replacement operation at the request of the athletes,"" it said in a statement.

Harper, who won women's 3m synchronised springboard bronze with partner Scarlett Mew Jensen, said later in the Games she had noticed ""small bits of tarnishing"".

That came after American skateboarder Nyjah Huston criticised the quality of his medal, posting a video of the bronze he won in the men's street skateboarding that appeared discoloured and chipped.

A Paris 2024 spokesperson said at the time it was working closely with the Monnaie de Paris to understand the cause of the damage and promised ""damaged medals will be systematically replaced and engraved in an identical way to the originals""."

Ms Bulley, 45, disappeared in St Michael's on Wyre in January 2023 with her body later found a mile from where she was last seen after she had fallen in the River Wyre and accidentally drowned.

The force said the mother of PC Molly Bury, 28, was overheard at an event in Burnley telling someone ""Molly checked the police system"" before it emerged the officer had illegally accessed police computer systems over several years.

Lancashire Police said they received a report in March 2023 ""regarding the potential unauthorised disclosure of sensitive police information"".

A former police officer has been handed a suspended sentence after sharing information with her family about the Nicola Bulley investigation.

Gross misconduct

A warrant was served at a property in Oswaldtwistle in December 2023 and electronic devices were seized, which revealed Bury had accessed police computer systems between 31 October 2019 and 8 May 2023 while on rest days or off sick.

The force said PC Bury had also told her mother about other investigations including a rape and a murder.

Bury, who worked as a response officer, was arrested and interviewed in March before being summonsed to appear at court.

She later admitted 32 counts under the Computer Misuse Act and received a six-month suspended sentence at Chester Magistrates' Court.

Bury resigned as a police officer while under investigation.

A case of gross misconduct was proved at an accelerated misconduct hearing held last year where it was deemed had she not already resigned she would have been dismissed.

She has also been added to the police barred list.

Det Ch Insp Pete Reil said: ""The public trust the police with their data, particularly when they or their loved ones have been victims of crime.

""They expect officers and police staff to act responsibly and sensitively with it.

""Molly Bury's behaviour fell way below what the constabulary expects and what the public would expect of a serving police officer."""

Capcom It's a big one - almost a million people have played Monster Hunter Wilds on PC within hours of its launch

The latest release in one of Japan's most popular video game series has had one of the most successful debuts of all time. More than one million players have logged on to the PC version of Monster Hunter Wilds within hours of its launch, according to figures from online store Steam. There have been complaints from the first wave of players on Steam about the game's performance on computers, but its critical response has been positive. BBC Newsbeat spoke to director Yuya Tokuda and producer Ryozo Tsujimoto prior to the release of Wilds about turning the game into a global hit.

Monster Hunter first launched on the PlayStation 2 in 2004. As the title suggests, players spend the game navigating an area known as The Forbidden Lands capturing and battling a cast of increasingly fearsome beasts. Long-time fans of the series are drawn in by its challenging, complex systems and option to play co-operatively, teaming up with friends to take down massive foes. Breakout 2018 hit Monster Hunter World has has sold 21.3 million copies, according to publisher Capcom, rising to 28.1 million when sales of an upgraded 2019 edition are included. Producer Mr Tsujimoto told BBC Newsbeat the game was a culmination of all the work and lessons learned from previous titles on the series. ""Anything that we hadn't been doing we really tried to do with Monster Hunter World to get everything ready so that the game was ready to break through,"" he said.

Capcom Monster Hunter Wilds has been developed for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox

Games industry layoffs and studio closures in the West and Europe have led to fears of ""brain drain"" - a loss of knowledge as people leave companies or even look for work in different fields. Japan, where employment protections for workers are much stronger, has not been as badly affected and developers often stay with the same company for a long time. Monster Hunter director Mr Tokuda says he's worked on the series for 20 years and it's fed into his work on Wilds. ""It's the groundwork that you create with your previous titles that you hope can inform the success of later ones,"" he says. ""We have the ability to take data from past titles like Monster Hunter World and analyse that data in order to understand what players were enjoying and what we could improve."" Other Japanese studios are known for taking this iterative approach and building on what has come before. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the makers of the popular Yakuza series and its Like a Dragon spin-offs, have put out a new game more or less every year since 2020. The company's boss Masayoshi Yokoyama has spoken openly about how the team is happy to revisit previous locations and reuse elements from earlier games rather doing a ""fresh reboot"" each time. This can help to lower development costs and reduce the time it takes to make new titles.

'We're working in our own lanes'

The Japanese games industry was a dominant force from the 1980s until the early 2000s, but a power shift saw Western developers begin to lead the way. More recently, the country has been behind some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful titles released. At last year's Game Awards - described by some as the industry's answer to The Oscars - Japanese-made games occupied four of the six Game of the Year nominations. Mr Tsujimoto says he can't pinpoint a specific reason for this, but says the Monster Hunter team has learned there are certain things needed to make a ""triple-A success in today's market"". That includes translating games into various languages so they can be released simultaneously in different countries, and being mindful of growing your audience. ""We're always careful to design the experience so new players can get into the game,"" he adds.

Japan does face some of the same challenges as other developers worldwide. Player habits are changing, with PC gaming increasing in popularity, and as technology becomes more advanced making games becomes more expensive. Mr Tsujimoto says generational leaps ""push the industry forward"", bringing ""new opportunities and new complexities"". ""I don't think it's necessarily the most difficult it's ever been but there are always new challenges whenever technology leaps forward."" The games industry is also more competitive than ever - more video games are being released, and players are tending to stick with the same ones for longer periods. It leaves publishers of new releases fighting over a much smaller share of players' free time and 2025 has already been packed with big new releases. Mr Tsujimoto insists they haven't paid too much attention to that while working on Monster Hunter Wilds. ""It looks like a big year for everyone but we're really all just working in our own lanes,"" he says. ""We happened to have this launch window that's on the verge of some other big releases but we don't have access to that information before the general public."" For an established series that suddenly explodes in popularity, Mr Tokuda says a big challenge is pleasing old and new fans. ""You always have in your mind that there's people waiting for your next creation and they're the players you want to satisfy,"" he says. ""But you also have your own creative idea and want to follow that through."""

Watch: Inside a Texan supermax prison

A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares. A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, ""Where you from, ma'am?"" ""England."" ""Hope you enjoy Estelle,"" he says. ""Do you?"" I ask. ""A lot better than where I was before."" Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas. Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter. The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside. Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released. Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.

BBC/Lee Durant Built in 1984, the prison has housed some of America's most notorious villains

No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row. Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery. He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.

BBC/Lee Durant Inmate Jimmy Delgado hopes his role counselling other offenders will help change lives

""I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,"" he says. ""If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison."" Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government. The ""good time credit"" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well. Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.

Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison. ""They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,"" he says. ""I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works."" The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%). The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood. ""The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,"" Ms Mahmood says. ""They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s."" She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. ""It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.""

The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet. ""The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,"" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. ""And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem."" What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: ""To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community."" As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of ""diversion programmes"" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.

More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book. Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle. ""I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,"" Ms Mahmood says.

BBC/Lee Durant Justice secretary Shabana Mahmood says there is much the UK can learn from the Texan good time credit system

It's a plan with ""huge potential in the UK"" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive. ""It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,"" he says. But not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison. Samantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete. ""Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,"" she says. ""It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong."" It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding – and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers? The challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime."
Dodds exit signals Labour unease over Starmer's tough decisions,[],,"Dodds exit shows unease over Starmer's tough decisions

Keir Starmer has lost four senior ministers since coming to power last July. Although she was not a high profile minister, the departure of Anneliese Dodds is the most significant so far. She is the first to resign over policy. Although she says she will support the PM from the backbenches, her letter of resignation delivered a coruscating critique. She - along with most Labour MPs – recognises defence spending needs to rise, but she disagrees with how it is being funded. She suggests that Britain's reputation will be damaged - but she is also denting her leader's. In effect, she is saying he is being misleading over the effect of the cuts, which will ""remove food and healthcare from desperate people"". And that while he has made a tactical decision – essentially, using a defence spending hike to grease the wheels of his meeting with President Trump - she maintains that the PM has made a strategic error which could bolster Russia and China's global influence.

This is significant because Dodds is not a usual suspect when it comes to rebelling. She was initially appointed as Keir Starmer's shadow chancellor when he won the Labour leadership in 2020. At the time, she would have been something of a political soulmate, backing the policy positions he professed in the leadership contest. But she remained on the party's so-called 'soft Left' while Sir Keir moved away and strongly backed the approach of his next shadow chancellor – Rachel Reeves – and her ""iron clad"" fiscal rules.

Ukraine war: Can Europe deter Russia without US military?,[],,"Can Europe deter Russia in Ukraine without US military?

Donald Trump appears to have more confidence in the capabilities of Britain's armed forces than some of his own generals - or, for that matter, many of Britain's retired military top brass.

When asked at his news conference with the UK prime minister about US security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump said: ""The British have incredible soldiers, incredible military and they can take care of themselves.""

However, the US president did leave the question hanging in the air as to whether the UK military could take on Russia.

In public, senior US military officers are quick to praise the professionalism of Britain's armed forces. But in private, they're often highly critical of recent cuts to their size, especially to the British Army, which now has just over 70,000 regular troops.

""Too small"" is what one very senior US general said in a private briefing on a visit to the UK.

According to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Russia's military expenditure is now higher than Europe's total defence spending, in terms of purchasing parity power. It's increased by 41% and is now the equivalent of 6.7% of GDP. In contrast, the UK will be spending just 2.5% by 2027.

President Trump's comments underscore the reality that he's not contemplating putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine to police any ceasefire. Any US presence will be economic, to exploit mining interests.

He suggests that that in itself might be a deterrent to Russia attacking again. But even his administration thinks there must be some hard power too - provided by others. It'll be up to European nations to do that. The question is not just whether Europe has the will: does it have the numbers too?

The short answer is no. That is why Sir Keir Starmer has been pressing for additional US security guarantees from the world's most powerful military.

Britain is not alone in cutting its armed forces in response to the end of the Cold War. That trend in Europe is slowly being reversed, with more nations increasing defence spending.

But Europe, on its own, would not be able to provide a force of 100-200,000 international troops, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggests would be needed to deter Russia from attacking again.

Instead, Western officials have said they're thinking of a force of up to 30,000 troops. European jets and warships would help monitor Ukraine's airspace and shipping lanes.

That force would be focused on providing ""reassurance"" at key sites - Ukraine's cities, ports and nuclear power stations. They would not be placed anywhere near the current front lines in Eastern Ukraine. European fighter jets and warships would also monitor Ukraine's air space and shipping lanes."
US-UK trade deal: Would an agreement change anything?,[],,"Faisal Islam: Any Starmer deal with Trump is all about avoiding tariffs

The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions. It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position. Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more. There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president, ""ripping off"" or ""screwing"" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU. So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards. But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era. It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU. It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table. In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its ""Brexit reset"" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.

The narrower ""economic deal"", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the ""further integration of our two countries' tech sectors"". Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here. This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes. The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces. While the £700m-£1bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit. The White House wants to ""stop the contagion"", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago. Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called ""freedom of speech"" issues. This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.

Hannaway family Demi Hannaway was 23 when she died in the home she shared with Andrew Brown

Scotland's most senior law officer has ordered a fresh investigation into the death of a woman who was abused by her partner. Demi Hannaway, from Airdrie, died in May 2021 after being the subject of physical and mental abuse at the hands of Andrew Brown. Her family said they were ""over the moon"" at the move, which was confirmed during a meeting with Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC. They previously said Police Scotland were too quick to conclude that the 23-year-old had killed herself.

Demi's mother Helen Simpson told BBC Scotland News: ""We are just overwhelmed at the moment. ""It has been a long fight but, finally, our daughter's voice has been heard."" The lord advocate said: ""I understand the huge loss felt by everyone who loved Demi and their desire to know what happened to her. ""The details of Demi's passing have been discussed with her parents. ""In recognition of their ongoing concerns, I have instructed a reinvestigation by a team of specialist prosecutors to ensure that every aspect of this tragedy is addressed."" Ms Bain added she valued meeting the family and hearing their views. She added: ""We will remain in contact with them and continue to provide updates as the reinvestigation progresses.""

Demi's parents, John and Helen, welcomed the development after their meeting with the Lord Advocate in Edinburgh

BBC Scotland News previously told how the family lodged a 32-point formal complaint to the force which highlighted its serious concerns over the police response. The issues identified include: Officers taking an hour to arrive at Demi's home. Claims that Brown told a police officer it was ""all his fault"". Evidence, they say, of a violent struggle in the house. The mother-of-two's phone was also found, by her family, under her bed smashed with the sim card missing after officers left. Brown, 33, was jailed for three years and seven months at Airdrie Sheriff Court last May after admitting threatening and abusive behaviour. After his conviction, Ms Simpson described him as a ""danger to women"" and said the charge should have been upgraded to culpable homicide. The couple first met in 2016 and moved in together after she became pregnant with their first child.

Hannaway family Demi's family said there had been no previous signs of an abusive relationship

Police Scotland initially ruled Demi's death was non-suspicious. But it later emerged she had made a call to a friend asking him to get Brown out of their house hours before she died at about 06:00 on 13 May 2021. Demi's sister, Caitlin, later accessed her phone and uncovered images showing injuries caused by Brown. These included pictures of bruising around her eye and neck that Demi had photographed before her death. There were also messages from Brown calling her a ""cancerous cow"" and telling her he ""hoped she would die"". Demi's father, John, said they had no idea about the abuse during the pair's relationship and said she had ""sung his praises"" when they were together. Friends also came forward to share their experience of the pair's relationship as part of the initial three-year Crown Office investigation. Brown was jailed for 43 months, but the family believes his sentence should have been longer.

WhatsApp said the issues, largely impacting users' ability to send messages, had now been resolved.

Messaging service WhatsApp went down briefly on Friday afternoon, thousands of users reported.

Some users reported problems affecting Facebook and Facebook Messenger, but in much fewer numbers than WhatsApp.

The end to end encrypted messaging app, acquired by Meta in 2014, has nearly three billion users worldwide.

Meta's last mass global outage affected WhatsApp and Instagram in December.

The company's boss Mark Zuckerberg told investors at the end of January that the company was ""making progress towards becoming the leading messaging platform in the US like it is in a lot of the rest of the world"".

In October, he said more than two billion calls were happening globally on the app every day.

But the scale of the app's user base can mean that any glitches are felt by millions of users across the globe.

However, few of the recent technical difficulties affecting Meta's apps have come close to mirroring the impact of its outage in 2021, which saw the company's apps go down for nearly six hours worldwide."

Francis Ford Coppola, one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers, has been named worst director for his self-financed project Megalopolis in this year's Razzies. Announced two days before the Oscars reward Hollywood's finest, the Razzie Awards name and shame the year's worst films. In an Instagram post, Coppola said he was ""thrilled"" to accept the award, ""at a time when so few have the courage to go against the prevailing trends of contemporary movie-making"". Madame Web picked up the award for worst picture, screenplay and actress for its star Dakota Johnson, while Joker: Folie à Deux also collected two awards.

The organisers have described their awards as the ""ugly cousin to the Oscars"". Megalopolis, an epic fantasy starring Adam Driver, Shia LaBeouf, Aubrey Plaza and Nathalie Emmanuel, cost Coppola a reported $120m (£95m). It also faced controversy after the trailer was withdrawn by studio Lionsgate, because the clip included fabricated quotes from real film critics about the filmmaker's previous works. List of nominations in full for Oscars 2025 ""Even a cinematic maestro occasionally musters up a misfire,"" the Razzies said, in a press release announcing Coppola's win. It comes almost exactly 50 years after Coppola won a best director Oscar for The Godfather part II. In his Instagram post, Coppola said: ""In this wreck of a world today, where art is given scores as if it were professional wrestling, I chose to not follow the gutless rules laid down by an industry so terrified of risk that despite the enormous pool of young talent at its disposal, may not create pictures that will be relevant and alive 50 years from now."" He concluded his post by thanking everyone who worked on the film, adding: ""Box office is only about money, and like war, stupidity and politics has no true place in our future.""

GPs in England strike deal to help end '8am scramble' for appointments,[],,"GPs strike deal to help end '8am scramble' for appointments

The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), says the deal is an important first step in restoring general practices.

The Labour government made manifesto promises to bring back ""family"" doctors and end the early morning phone ""scramble"" for appointments.

The deal gives an extra £889m a year to general practices, as well as a reduction in red tape and targets that ministers hope will mean doctors are freed up to see more patients.

Patients will be able to book more appointments online and request to see their usual doctor under a new contract agreed with England's GPs, the government has said.

The new contract says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need.

Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised.

It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up.

Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am.

Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar ""8am scramble"" for a same-day appointment.

Patients have felt it too, with some people facing long waits for appointments.

GP surgeries are seen as the front door to the NHS but for years now, doctors have been warning about the pressure their service is under.

However, doctors also want the government to commit to talks about a completely new national contract for GPs within this parliament.

More money to cover rising costs

The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2%.

The total figure includes almost £800m to cover rising costs, such as staff wages, repairs and maintenance of buildings and more patients.

Other measures include a greater flexibility for surgeries when it comes to employing different healthcare staff.

GPs will get paid more to carry out routine childhood vaccinations.

Through cutting what the government describes as ""box-ticking targets"", ministers say GPs will be freed up to take the first steps towards ending the ""8am scramble"" for an appointment.

Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting says that these are the first steps in fixing what he describes as ""a broken NHS"".

""Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared,"" he said.

""That's why patients are struggling to get an appointment.

""This government is cutting the red tape that ties up GPs' time and backing them with an extra £889m next year.

""In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment.""

Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed.

""We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning – what we now need is certainty about our collective future.

""We know the Treasury will be announcing its funding plans for this Parliament this spring, and we need to see a new substantive GP practice contract for England in the upcoming comprehensive spending review.""

Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to ""desperation point"" over the last 15 years - with ""thousands"" of GPs leaving.

She explained the ""first signs of green shoots"" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.

She indicated patients would ""potentially"" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are ""nowhere near a solution"".

Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.

Dr Taylor said: ""The new GP contract goes a small way to fix some of the significant issues for GP practices, in that it prevents further declines in funding with a small percentage increase.""

But a much larger investment will be needed to build for the future, he added.

Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster and ex-executive member of the doctors' union, the BMA, said he was disappointed with the new contract.

""There is little in this contract that is going to help patients access care quicker than they do already because it hasn't managed to address the underlying issue of national insurance contributions and the vast sums of money that will need to go towards that,"" he added.

Meanwhile, Azeem Majeed, London GP and professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said overall, the contract was a positive development.

""It is good that an agreement has been reached. But a lot of work still needs to be done to improve the lives of patients, GPs and other primary care staff.

""The priority should be recruiting more nurses and GPs to help increase appointments,"" he said.

""But it will take some time for people to see improvements from this investment."""

A screenprint of the late Queen Elizabeth II by artist Andy Warhol is among dozens of images of the royal family which have gone on display in Edinburgh. Royal Portraits: A Century Of Photography is due to run until 7 September at The King's Gallery in the Palace of Holyroodhouse, having previously been exhibited at Buckingham Palace. The exhibition chronicles the evolution of royal portrait photography from the 1920s until the coronation of the King in 2023, with more than 90 prints, proofs and documents from the Royal Collection and the Royal Archives. Many images are being shown in Scotland for the first time and all the photographs are original vintage prints.

The earliest surviving colour print of a member of the royal family was taken by Madame Yevonde, a pioneer of the craft in 1935, showing Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester - and sister-in-law to King George VI and Edward VIII - on her wedding day. Among the photographs in the exhibition are those taken to mark milestone birthdays, including ""coming of age"" images of Princess Anne to mark her 21st birthday in 1971, which were taken by Norman Parkinson in Frogmore House gardens. Some of Cecil Beaton's most memorable photographs taken over 60 years are on show, including original coronation portraits of Queen Elizabeth II.

A man accused of stealing a £4.8m golden toilet used it on a visit to Blenheim Palace the day before the heist, describing it as ""splendid"", a court has heard. The artwork, called America, was taken from the stately home in Oxfordshire in the early hours of 14 September 2019, two days after it went on display. Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, denies one count of burglary. Frederick Doe, 36, from Windsor and 41-year-old Bora Guccuk, from west London, both deny conspiring to transfer criminal property. Giving evidence, Mr Jones said he had visited the exhibition the day before and been ""at home in bed"" when the toilet was stolen.

The 18-carat gold, fully-functional toilet was part of an exhibition by the Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan. The court previously heard Mr Jones had visited the palace twice before the theft. Prosecution barrister Julian Christopher KC asked Mr Jones why he had taken a half-day off work on the Friday to visit the palace, rather than waiting until the weekend. Mr Jones admitted he did not often book half-days off work to go to museums and exhibitions but it was because he ""was interested to go and see it"". Members of the public booked slots to use the toilet in its cubicle as part of the exhibition. Photos he had taken were again listed to the jury and Jones said he took many of them because they were ""interesting"" views or pieces of art. One was of the window later broken to steal the gold toilet, jurors were told. A lock on the cubicle to the toilet was also photographed. Jones said it was because he thought it was ""quite funny that you could actually lock yourself in the toilet"". Questioned if he ""took advantage of"" the gold toilet's ""facilities"", he told the court that he did make use of it. Crispin Aylett KC, defence counsel for Mr Doe, asked Mr Jones ""what was it like?"" and Mr Jones replied ""splendid"".

Thames Valley Police Jurors were shown CCTV of Michael Jones visiting Blenheim Palace

A fourth man, James Sheen, 40, from Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, has previously pleaded guilty to burglary. Jones told the court he was friends with Sheen and that he worked as a roofer and general builder for Sheen's building firm. During his evidence he said that messages and voice notes between the two of them around the time of the heist were work-related or about a large dog kennel he was planning to help Sheen collect from Milton Keynes immediately after his visit to the exhibition. He denied that his two visits to the palace in the days before the raid were as reconnaissance for the robbery. He told the jury he went to the palace on 7 September to see a car show and again on the 13 September to see the exhibition.

GB News has won its judicial review of decisions made by TV watchdog Ofcom, that two shows hosted by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg breached the broadcasting code. The High Court judgment by Mrs Justice Collins Rice concluded that Ofcom's rulings were unlawful. It is the first time the watchdog has lost such a case. The judgement said Ofcom's initial rulings - that the 9 May and 13 June 2023 broadcasts were in breach of its codes on ""due impartiality and due accuracy in news"" - were unlawful. GB News CEO Angelos Frangopoulos said the decision ""vindicates GB News' position as the fearless defender of free speech in the United Kingdom"", while Ofcom said it ""accepted the court's guidance"".

'Fundamental failure'

Mr Frangopoulos added: ""I call on the government and Parliament to consider the seriousness of this fundamental failure by Ofcom."" The judge's ruling stated: ""I am minded to quash the two decisions in this case, and remit them to be reconsidered by Ofcom, subject to whatever further procedure may be fairly indicated."" The court found that Ofcom had misapplied Rule 5.3 of the code, saying the provision only applies to ""news programmes"" and not to current affairs shows, such as the one Sir Jacob hosts. The decisions had been made as part of five GB News rulings by Ofcom in March last year, including three about shows hosted by Esther McVey and Philip Davies. Ofcom's rulings had said the State of the Nation shows hosted by Sir Jacob broke rules stating politicians should not usually front news coverage. The Ofcom code says a politician can't be a newsreader, interviewer or reporter in a news programme ""unless, exceptionally, it is editorially justified"". They can, however, front current affairs shows. At the time, Sir Jacob was the Conservative MP for North East Somerset.

McCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.

The alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.

Recalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter."
Tour de France: Great Britain set to host Grand Depart of men's race in 2027,['Dan Roan'],,"The Grand Depart of the men's Tour de France is set to return to Great Britain in 2027, BBC Sport has learned.

Britain last hosted the start of the world's most famous cycling race in Yorkshire in 2014, when it began in Leeds, followed by stages finishing in Sheffield and London.

GB's first Grand Depart took place in London in 2007.

Details of the route are still being finalised, and advanced talks between British sports authorities and race organisers continue.

But according to well-placed sources, an official announcement could come as early as next month.

Funding body UK Sport identified the 2027 Tour as one which could begin in Britain in a list of international event hosting targets last year, and has been in negotiations with race organisers ASO, alongside British Cycling.

In a statement, UK Sport said, ""We have made no secret of our ambition to host the Tour de France Grand Depart in Britain - to inspire more people to enjoy cycling and bring lasting benefits to communities.

""However, we respect this is a matter for the ASO and we remain committed to working hard to develop opportunities that can bring the joy of cycling to everyone.""

According to an official report, crowds at the roadside for the three English stages in 2014 totalled 4.8 million, with 3.5m individual spectators.

That helped generate an estimated £128m in total revenue, with £102m in Yorkshire alone.

Last year's Grand Depart took place in Florence, Italy, with the 2026 race due to start in Spain in Barcelona.

In 2021, the British government said it was allocating millions of pounds to try to bring the Grand Depart back for the 2026 Tour with stages across England, Scotland and Wales, but the bid was then abandoned.

Two years later, Scotland Cycling also said it wanted to stage the race after the country hosted the UCI World Championships.

Then in 2024 an Ireland bid to host the Grand Depart in either 2026 or 2027 was withdrawn."

What We Know About the U.S.-Ukraine Minerals Deal,"['Maria Varenikova', 'Constant Méheut', 'More About Maria Varenikova', 'More About Constant Méheut']",,"Terms of the agreement

It is not clear if the two sides have reached final agreement on the terms of the deal.

A draft seen by The New York Times dated Feb. 25 described the creation of a U.S.-controlled fund that would receive revenue from Ukraine’s natural resources.

Missing from the draft was Mr. Trump’s initial demand that Ukraine contribute $500 billion to a fund owned by the United States and pay back twice the amount of any future American aid.

Under the draft agreement, Ukraine would contribute into the fund half of its revenues from the future monetization of natural resources, including critical minerals, oil and gas, as well as earnings from associated infrastructure, such as liquefied natural gas terminals and port infrastructure.

The fund would not draw on revenue from existing mines, oil wells and other natural resources businesses.

The United States would own the maximum financial interest in the fund allowed under American law, though not necessarily all. It is unclear how that would be interpreted.

The fund would be designed to reinvest some revenues into Ukraine.

Security guarantee

The draft vaguely referenced security guarantees, but did not signal any specific U.S. commitment to safeguarding Ukraine’s security — a provision Kyiv has vigorously pressed to include as its war against Russia enters its fourth year."
How Elon Musk Executed His Takeover of the Federal Bureaucracy,"['Jonathan Swan', 'Theodore Schleifer', 'Maggie Haberman', 'Ryan Mac', 'Kate Conger', 'Nicholas Nehamas', 'Madeleine Ngo', 'More About Jonathan Swan', 'More About Theodore Schleifer', 'More About Maggie Haberman']",2025-02-28,"Seasoned conservative operatives like Stephen Miller and Russell Vought helped educate Mr. Musk about the workings of the bureaucracy. Soon, he stumbled on an opening. It was a little-known unit with reach across the government: the U.S. Digital Service, which President Barack Obama created in 2014 after the botched rollout of healthcare.gov.

Mr. Musk and his advisers — including Steve Davis, a cost cutter who worked with him at X and other companies — did not want to create a commission, as past budget hawks had done. They wanted direct, insider access to government systems. They realized they could use the digital office, whose staff had been focused on helping agencies fix technology problems, to quickly penetrate the federal government — and then decipher how to break it apart.

They would call it the U.S. DOGE Service, and they would not even have to change the initials.

They began their move on the digital service unit earlier than has previously been reported, The Times found, while President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was still in office — giving them the ability to operate on Mr. Trump’s first day.

Around the time that Mr. Musk identified the office as a key part of his strategy late last year, the Trump transition team gained a key ally on the inside. A U.S.D.S. veteran named Amy Gleason rejoined its staff as a senior adviser at the end of the Biden administration, described to other employees as someone who would aid the Trump transition. Ms. Gleason, who would later be named the acting administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency, recommended that the unit bring aboard several young engineers who would later become part of Mr. Musk’s team.

Allies of Mr. Musk, meanwhile, fanned out across the government as part of the transition, extracting intelligence about computer systems, contracts and personnel."
How Elon Musk Built His DOGE Operation: Timeline and Key Takeaways,['The New York Times'],2025-02-28,"The billionaire Elon Musk knew little about the inner workings of the federal government when Donald J. Trump tapped him last year to lead a commission to overhaul the bureaucracy.

The New York Times interviewed more than 60 people familiar with Mr. Musk’s effort to piece together new details about the operation, which Mr. Musk and his advisers mapped out in a series of closely held meetings in Palm Beach, Fla., and through early intelligence-gathering efforts in Washington.

Here’s what we learned:

He got a crash course in the executive branch.

Ensconced at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida after the election, Mr. Musk immersed himself in the workings of the bureaucracy, educated by seasoned conservative operatives like Stephen Miller, who is now deputy chief of staff, and Russell T. Vought, now the director of the Office of Management and Budget.

He realized the advantage of an inside strategy.

Mr. Musk and his allies did not want to create a commission, as past budget hawks had done; they wanted direct, insider access to government systems.

"In Texas Measles Outbreak, Signs of a Riskier Future for Children","['Teddy Rosenbluth', 'Desiree Rios', 'More About Teddy Rosenbluth']",2025-02-28,"Every day, as Dr. Wendell Parkey enters his clinic in Seminole, a small city on the rural western edge of Texas, he announces his arrival to the staff with an anthem pumping loudly through speakers.

As the song reaches a climax, he throws up an arm and strikes a pose in cowboy boots. “Y’all ready to stomp out disease?” he asks.

Recently, the question has taken on a dark urgency. Seminole Memorial Hospital, where Dr. Parkey has practiced for nearly three decades, has found itself at the center of the largest measles outbreak in the United States since 2019.

Since last month, more than 140 Texas residents, most of whom live in the surrounding Gaines County, have been diagnosed and 20 have been hospitalized. Nine people in a bordering county in New Mexico have also fallen ill."
Measles Outbreaks: What to Know About Virus Severity and Vaccine Effectiveness,"['Nina Agrawal', 'More About Nina Agrawal']",2025-02-28,"“While we certainly see measles cases from time to time, it’s a rarity that we see an unfolding outbreak of this scale,” said Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health. At least 164 people have been sickened with measles so far this year. That is more than half the number of cases in all of 2024, and higher than the 59 cases documented in 2023.

How ‘normal’ are measles outbreaks?

Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, which was considered a landmark public health achievement made possible by the vaccine. Since then, there have been cases every year — typically originating with somebody who traveled abroad to a destination where measles is more common, and brought the virus back.

But in the first decade after elimination, the virus didn’t spread beyond a small number of people, experts said, because most people in a given community were vaccinated. That has changed, however, in recent years. In the 2023-24 school year, 39 states had measles vaccination rates below 95 percent, the target rate to achieve the “herd immunity” that can stem the spread of the virus. That’s up from 28 states during the 2019-20 school year, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.

Lower vaccination rates have made it possible for larger outbreaks to occur more easily. That was the case in Southern California in 2014 and 2015, when an outbreak linked to Disneyland grew to about 150 cases, and in New York in 2018 and 2019, when more than 600 cases emerged in New York City and another 300 in Rockland County.

“That is becoming, unfortunately, a more common reality in the United States because of decreased vaccination rates of our population,” said Dr. Lori Handy, an associate director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia."
Do You Need a Measles Booster?,"['Dani Blum', 'More About Dani Blum']",2025-02-27,"Measles outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico are fueling concerns about the rapid spread of the highly contagious virus.

There have been more than 100 measles cases in the United States so far this year, compared to 285 cases in all of 2024. And health officials have warned that they expect more people to fall ill.

The outbreaks come as the rate of childhood vaccinations, including against measles, have fallen. Most of the measles cases in recent outbreaks have been among people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown. Many have been young children, who are at particularly high risk. An unvaccinated child died in Texas from measles, health officials reported Wednesday.

Vaccines are the most effective tools to combat measles. Breakthrough cases — infections among the vaccinated — are extremely rare. But as outbreaks spread, it’s important to review your own vaccination status and make sure you are properly protected."
Federal Workers Will Get Another Email Asking Them to Detail Accomplishments,"['Madeleine Ngo', 'Eileen Sullivan', 'More About Madeleine Ngo', 'More About Eileen Sullivan']",2025-02-28,"It is possible that more employees will be expected to respond to an email with such instructions if it comes from their agency, and not the Office of Personnel Management.

The decision to send out another round of emails was first reported by The Washington Post.

Recent legal challenges have tested the limits of power that the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources arm, wields over the federal civilian work force, which is made up of roughly 2.3 million people. On Thursday night, a federal judge ruled that the agency had exceeded its authority when it issued memos outlining steps to fire most federal workers on probation.

“Congress has given the authority to hire and fire to the agencies themselves,” Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California said. “The Office of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute — in the history of the universe — to hire and fire employees within another agency.”

Earlier this week, Mr. Musk explained why he wanted federal employees to respond to the email.

“What we are trying to get to the bottom of is, we think there are a number of people on the government payroll who are dead, which is probably why they can’t respond,” Mr. Musk said during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. “So, we’re just literally trying to figure out are these people real, are they alive, and can they write an email, which I think is a reasonable expectation.”

In a memo published on Monday, the Office of Personnel Management urged agencies to consider whether they should require employees to submit bullets about their achievements as part of weekly activity reports.

The memo also directed agencies to “consider any appropriate actions regarding employees who fail to respond” and that it was up to their leadership to determine what actions should be taken.

Trump’s Cuts Come With Risks. Including From Volcanoes.,"['Raymond Zhong', 'More About Raymond Zhong']",2025-02-28,"When the fuming and rumbling at Mount Spurr, a giant volcano northwest of Anchorage, started picking up in October, Alaska’s volcano monitoring agency raised its alert level to ensure that nearby communities and passing airplanes would have ample warning of any eruption.

The Trump administration’s cost-cutting campaign has put this work in jeopardy.

The credit cards that employees at the United States Geological Survey’s volcano observatory in Alaska use to pay for travel and other expenses have been frozen, according to two people who requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak with the news media.

Crucially, those expenses include the telecommunications services that the observatory relies on to transmit data from its monitoring systems on the volcanoes, the people said. If spending continues to be restricted, these services could be shut off. That might mean a loss of real-time information about volcanic activity, the people said.

And, if employees can’t pay for travel, then they won’t be able to go into the field by helicopter and boat to repair and maintain their monitoring equipment. Much of this gear sits in remote, rugged environments, where it is vulnerable to damage from storms and extreme winter conditions."
Oil Companies Wanted Trump to Lower Costs. Tariffs Are Raising Them.,"['Rebecca F. Elliott', 'More About Rebecca F. Elliott']",2025-02-28,"At the same time, consumers have grown jittery about the economy and the price of oil has fallen about 10 percent since just before Mr. Trump took office, to around $70 a barrel. Oil companies tend to drill less when prices fall.

The combination could complicate Mr. Trump’s stated desire to juice U.S. oil and natural gas production, which is already at or near record highs.

“Our ability to ‘drill, baby, drill’ is directly tied to the economics of the well,” said Lori Blong, the mayor of Midland, Texas, which is at the heart of the most prolific U.S. oil basin. “We can’t drill ourselves into a bind.”

A planned 25 percent tariff on imported steel, set to take effect March 12, is very consequential to U.S. oil and gas producers, whose wells often stretch miles into the earth. The steel pipe that they use to line those holes can account for 10 percent of the total well cost.

Mr. Trump said in early February that he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. The price of steel pipe was already rising before that announcement and has climbed since."

The document, a search warrant return, showed that police officers recovered thyroid medication, Tylenol and diltiazem — a drug often used to treat high blood pressure or chest pain — from the home outside of Santa Fe, N.M., where the couple was found dead on Wednesday.

It was not clear whether the medications listed were the pills that investigators had described as being scattered near Ms. Arakawa’s body. The search warrant return, which was signed by a Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office detective, did not give any indication of what was in the monthly planner.

The return said officers had also found records from MyQuest, an online medical portal where patients can review test results and make doctor’s appointments. Officers also recovered two green cellphones."

Even in his box-office heyday, Gene Hackman had a receding hairline and a paunch. He could pass for 50 when he was 30. He described himself as a “big lummox kind of person.”

His first noteworthy role came alongside Jean Seberg in the 1964 film “Lillith.” Ms. Seberg said she found Mr. Hackman handsome because his face had so much character to it — but she didn’t believe he would go very far in an industry that favored Warren Beatty and other more conventionally attractive men.

But changing attitudes demanded a new kind of star, and Mr. Hackman arrived when the sharp-focus cinema of the midcentury years gave way to the grainier palette of the 1970s, a time when the line between hero and antihero was blurring."

The sheriff’s office, which is conducting the investigation, said in a statement on Thursday afternoon that “there were no apparent signs of foul play.” But in an interview Friday morning with the “Today” show on NBC, Sheriff Mendoza said he was “not ruling that out.”

The Fire Department did not find signs of a carbon monoxide leak, according to the search warrant affidavit, and Santa Fe’s fire chief, Brian Moya, said on Friday that two separate searches of the property “didn’t find anything” that would point to a gas leak.

That’s a line you won’t remember unless you watched the deleted scenes on the DVD version of the movie, one of which shows Buddy rejoining the team after deciding not to play for a different school.

“I share about a five-minute dialogue with Coach Dale, where I get my second chance, where I see the error of my ways,” Long said. “It’s just he and I; it’s a kind of a tender moment, and it doesn’t make it to the screen!”

Long said that while the director and writer of the film felt it was a crucial scene, the producers thought that he looked too much like another character, Jimmy, and that audiences would be confused.

“That is a scene that will stick with me,” Long said, “because I remember concentrating on the scene, and then somebody grabbed me from behind. It was Gene, who said, ‘That was great.’ And I never forget that came from Gene Hackman.”

‘I love you guys.’

Hackman’s whispered words to his team are one of the movie’s emotional high points.

“I was behind a locker, standing back there, just listening,” said Ross, who was not in the scene. “He didn’t make an emotional thing out of it; he did not emote at any point. But just the power of the sincerity of it struck me.”"
How Einav Zangauker Became Netanyahu’s Fiercest Foe,['Ruth Margalit'],2025-02-28,"More hostage releases were set to unfold over the following days, but the 2023 deal soon collapsed: Israel blamed Hamas for reneging on the terms of the agreement by attempting to release three corpses instead of three living female hostages. Members of Israel’s war cabinet argued in closed meetings that Israel should overlook the infraction and maintain the cease-fire, to save as many hostages as it could. “I thought that it was right to continue implementing the deal in any way possible,” Gadi Eisenkot, a retired general and member of the war cabinet, told the investigative news show “Uvda” last year. But Netanyahu and his broader security cabinet overruled them. That night, Israel resumed its bombing campaign in Gaza. “That was my first breaking point,” Einav told me. “I remember thinking, How do I peel myself off the floor?”

That winter, Einav met with Netanyahu for a second time since the attacks, along with relatives of other hostages. “We will do everything in our power to bring your loved ones home,” he told them again. When the families pressed him on what he meant by “everything,” Netanyahu waffled, according to Einav. “That’s when the thought started to nag at me that something bad was happening,” she told me. Einav disagreed with the few families at that meeting who called for preventing humanitarian aid from entering Gaza. Einav knew from Ilana that what little food the hostages received came from the aid packages, and a blockade would also hurt everyday Palestinians, which she found morally wrong. But Netanyahu “seemed to back those families, after telling us something completely different,” she told me. “I realized that his war goals” — to eliminate Hamas and bring back the hostages — “were on a collision course.”

Gil Dickmann, whose cousin was among those captured from Kibbutz Be’eri, recalled paying attention to Einav at that meeting. “She had a no-bullshit attitude,” he said. She told me that she was the last to speak, and she informed Netanyahu that just as her vote gave him a mandate to lead, she would “take that mandate away.” In the months before that meeting, “We had a sense that we were being played, but we didn’t know by whom,” Dickmann said. “Then, as time passed, it became clear who the biggest player of all was. It became clear that the person responsible was Netanyahu.”

By then, several hostage families had begun to protest outside the I.D.F. headquarters near Begin Road. They hoped to intercept politicians and security chiefs as they drove into the compound. The first to do so was Avichai Brodutch, a pineapple grower from Kibbutz Kfar Aza whose wife and children were captured from their home. Days after the attacks, he set up a chair and a hand-drawn sign: “My family is in Gaza.” He was soon joined by Hadas Kalderon, whose two children and ex-husband, Ofer, were also held hostage by Hamas. Kalderon and a handful of other women formed a group called the Mothers’ Guard. Einav occasionally drove by with her daughters and offered her support, but she initially shied away from public action. As she put it, “I was still under the influence of the Bibi-ist cult.”

The Brodutch and Kalderon children were returned as part of the 2023 truce deal. Hadas and Avichai now devoted themselves to their children’s rehabilitation. So Ifat Kalderon, Ofer’s cousin, took over the Begin Road guard with a handful of other relatives and supporters. In February 2024, Einav, still anguished after the meeting with Netanyahu, decided to sleep outside the defense headquarters until Matan returned. Kalderon and the other women arranged a tent and blankets for her and offered their sympathies. Once the police ordered her to remove the tent, she joined the rest of the group at Begin."

His doctors have always said that the pope is not out of danger, and that the overall the situation is complex.

The bronchial crisis on Friday afternoon was an isolated incident, the Vatican said. It said that as a result, he required “noninvasive mechanical ventilation” — meaning he was not intubated, which requires sedation.

Francis is now using a mask covering his mouth and nose to help him breathe. The Vatican said Francis was cooperating “with therapeutic maneuvers,” and was in “good spirits.”"
West Bank Operation Tests Palestinian Leaders’ Ability to Root Out Militants,"['Adam Rasgon', 'Fatima Abdulkarim', 'More About Adam Rasgon']",2025-02-28,"The Palestinian Authority was carrying out one of the most extensive security operations in its history, pursuing armed militants in the West Bank city of Jenin. For weeks, the authority’s forces slowly advanced on the militants’ densely populated stronghold, Palestinian officials said.

When the Israeli military launched its own wide-scale raid there in January, the authority was expected to abandon its operation.

But it did not.

Instead, when dozens of militants fled to nearby villages, Palestinian security forces swooped in to arrest them, officials said. “We made very important progress in reinforcing law and order,” Brig. Gen. Anwar Rajab, the spokesman for the authority’s security forces, said in a phone interview.

The authority, which has limited governing powers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, had for years largely ceded the fight against militants to Israel. But as questions swirl over whether it can take on governance and security in Gaza, the group’s leaders appear eager to demonstrate that they will not shy away from fighting — even if it means angering Palestinians who say the authority is abetting an operation that is destroying large parts of the West Bank and displacing tens of thousands."

Israeli negotiators are in Cairo for meetings with Egyptian and Qatari mediators to discuss the next steps in the truce. Hamas officials visited the Egyptian capital last week for their own deliberations.

According to the three-part cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas, Israeli forces are set to begin withdrawing from the Philadelphi Corridor six weeks into the truce, coinciding with the end of the first phase of the agreement, would expire on Saturday night.

The two sides concluded the final hostage-for-prisoner swaps in the first phase of the agreement on Thursday. They have yet to negotiate the next steps, which would include a permanent end to Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory.

Israel is supposed to leave the corridor by the end of next week, according to the cease-fire deal. The vacuum could be filled by Hamas, which has been reasserting its power in Gaza since the truce went into effect in mid-January.

Will Israel actually withdraw?

Israel agreed to leave the border area by the 50th day of the truce, which would be in early March. Refusing to abide by that commitment would be seen as a major violation and add even more uncertainty to the already precarious truce."
Turkey-PKK Deal May Benefit Erdogan at Home and Abroad,"['Carlotta Gall', 'More About Carlotta Gall']",2025-02-28,"By seeking a peace deal with Kurdish militants, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is attempting something momentous that not only aims to end 40 years of violent insurgency inside Turkey but envisions ambitious change across the region.

The call on Thursday by Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., for his militants to lay down their arms followed months of negotiations and was a well thought out answer to the challenges Mr. Erdogan faces, said Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington D.C.

At home it could earn Mr. Erdogan the Kurdish support he needs for constitutional changes to give the Turkish leader — who has steadily expanded his power over more than 20 years — another run at the presidency.

Farther afield, ending the conflict with Kurdish groups that are ranged across parts of Iraq, Syria and Turkey would release Turkey and its military of a huge burden.

"Oscar Nominees Makeup Got Real in 2025: “The Substance,” “Wicked” and More",['Kellina Moore'],2025-02-28,"Actors may deliver impassioned speeches about achieving their “childhood dreams,” but we don’t often hear about how those sculpting wounds with clay and bubbling skin with latex are fulfilling their lifelong fantasies.

“Teenager treats” is how Pierre Olivier Persin, the special effects designer nominated for an Oscar for makeup and hairstyling for “The Substance,” described his work on the film, which involved two full-body prosthetics and countless other pieces and puppets. Mike Marino, the makeup designer for Sebastian Stan in “A Different Man,” nominated in the same category, described his childhood bedroom as a sort of cabinet of curiosities, filled with “jars of experiments and screaming Siamese twins.”

It’s a particularly exciting year for makeup and hairstyling nominees: buckets of blood and pus-filled injections in “The Substance”; face tumors sloughing off like jelly in “A Different Man”; green witches and blue horses in “Wicked”; a vampire shriveling away in “Nosferatu”; and a menacing drug lord created with facial prosthetics in “Emilia Pérez.”"
Why These Oscars Mean So Much to Brazil,"['Jack Nicas', 'More About Jack Nicas']",2025-02-28,"In 2020, the American author Dave Eggers discovered a new translation of the 1881 novel “The Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas” by Machado de Assis, the inventive Brazilian writer. Mr. Eggers was stunned and wrote: “It is a glittering masterwork and an unmitigated joy to read, but, for no good reason at all, almost no English speakers in the twenty-first century have read it.”

Well, it may not be a good reason, but the reality is that, for generations, the West has generally viewed the cultural output from poorer countries as less relevant or important.

That is in part why Brazilians have largely been relegated to the “global music” and Latin categories of the Grammys, and the foreign-language category of the Oscars.

This year has brought exceptions. At the Grammys, Mr. Nascimento was nominated for best jazz album with the American jazz musician Esperanza Spalding. Yet at the ceremony, organizers seated him far in the back while putting Ms. Spalding up front, prompting her to protest.

At the Oscars, Ms. Torres is the second Brazilian to ever receive a best acting nomination. The first? Her mother, 25 years ago. Fernanda Montenegro, Brazil’s most celebrated actress, was nominated in 1999 for her role in “Central Station,” a Brazilian film by Walter Salles, the same director behind “I’m Still Here.” She lost to Gwyneth Paltrow, a decision that is decried in Brazil to this day."
A Guide to the Documentary Oscar Nominees,"['Alissa Wilkinson', 'More About Alissa Wilkinson']",2025-02-28,"Since the best documentary feature category was first established at the Oscars in 1942, the nominees have been like a snapshot of the year: wars and social concerns, heroes and headlines. This year is no exception. On paper, each of the five nominees look as if they’re ripped from the headlines, chosen for some metric like “urgency” or “timeliness.”

But these are no ordinary documentaries. In the past decade, the Academy has gotten much better about nominating nonfiction films that stretch and push at their boundaries, challenging audiences in how they convey their subject matter. Most opt to confront world events through intensely personal stories, and all of them carefully show why their individual stories have far-reaching implications.

So, as the 2025 Oscars are upon us, here’s a quick guide to the nominated films and why you should watch them.

With “Black Box Diaries” (streaming on Paramount+ with Showtime), the director Shitori Ito takes a courageously personal approach to her biting critique of the handling of sexual assault cases in Japan. In 2017, Ito held a news conference to announce allegations that a prominent Japanese journalist had raped her. In the documentary, she chronicles the fallout of that accusation. The film is both intimate and enraging. As Manohla Dargis wrote in her review, it’s “a tense and tangled crime story, one in which Ito is at once the victim, lead investigator, dogged prosecutor and crusading reporter.”"
Why China’s Xiaomi Can Make an Electric Car and Apple Can’t,"['Meaghan Tobin', 'Claire Fu', 'More About Meaghan Tobin', 'More About Claire Fu']",2025-02-28,"After nearly a decade of trying, Apple finally gave up its effort to produce an electric car last year, canceling a project that soaked up $10 billion.

But last year in China, the electronics maker Xiaomi launched its first electric car after just three years of development and delivered 135,000 vehicles. It has vowed to double that number in 2025.

Xiaomi’s ability to succeed where Apple could not shows how thoroughly China has come to dominate the supply chain for electric vehicles. Chinese companies have mastered electric vehicle manufacturing. By tapping that infrastructure, Xiaomi was able to get components quickly and cheaply.

More Chinese electric vehicle companies — including Leapmotor, Li Auto and Seres Group — are starting to turn a profit after burning cash for years in their intense competition for the world’s largest auto market."
"What if You Could Taste Food From 1,000 Miles Away?",['Veronique Greenwood'],2025-02-28,"Why, you might ask, would you want to taste someone else’s fish soup? Mr. Jia points out that it’s commonplace to be able to see and hear what’s going on far away. Why not be able to taste it? Or maybe you’d like to taste recipes in a cookbook before you commit to making them. Maybe someday there might be a button on online grocery shopping services so you could virtually taste test different hot sauces before buying them.

Right now, these scenarios might seem a bit whimsical and the device, to put it mildly, a tad cumbersome. The researchers behind the new paper, however, are not the only ones working on devices that could allow us to taste and smell things that are not in our immediate vicinity.

“There are people trying to do it with direct electrical stimulation on your tongue,” Mr. Jia said. “There are people trying to use other ways to deliver the chemicals. We are using a water pump.”

In this paper, the team’s pump sent various concentrations of lemonade flavoring to volunteers. They demonstrated that the study’s participants could reliably rate the samples by sourness. Whether the researchers dipped a sensor in lemonade to generate the flavor, or simply used a recipe to mix chemicals transmitted by the pump, the effects were similar.

When volunteers were sent the flavors of coffee, fried eggs, cake, lemonade and fish soup generated via chemical recipes, they were able to correctly identify which of the five tastes they’d been fed most of the time. With a wider variety of chemicals and more recipes, more foods could be simulated, the researchers suggest."
Opinion | The MAGA War on Speech,['The Editorial Board'],2025-02-28,"The White House press office then upped the ante; it is now keeping both A.P. reporters and photographers away from many press events and off Air Force One on presidential trips, making it far more difficult for the nation’s largest wire service to provide essential coverage. The A.P., to its great credit, has sued officials in the administration, saying it was doing so “to vindicate its rights to the editorial independence guaranteed by the United States Constitution and to prevent the executive branch from coercing journalists to report the news using only government-approved language.”

Federal District Judge Trevor McFadden has yet to rule on The A.P.’s request but made it clear that the White House appeared to be improperly punishing the wire service for its editorial decision. “It seems pretty clearly viewpoint discrimination,” the judge said at a preliminary hearing.

This struggle is obviously about more than the name of a body of water; the White House wants to use coercion to control how it is covered and even who gets to cover the president. On Tuesday the press office said it would begin handpicking the news organizations that cover Mr. Trump as part of the press pool — a decision that up to now was made by a group representing the news outlets themselves. The White House immediately cut Reuters and HuffPost from the pool and added two sycophantic outlets, Newsmax and The Blaze.

“The White House press pool exists to serve the public, not the presidency,” said Bruce Brown, the executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

Politicians are allowed to criticize the press — that is free speech, too, and there is nothing new about it — but there is a difference between using language and using muscle. Government officials are supposed to use their considerable regulatory powers for the benefit of the public, not for personal or partisan goals. This administration, however, is mustering the arms of government to suppress speech it doesn’t like and compel words and ideas it prefers. It sees the press not as an institution with an explicit constitutional privilege but as a barrier to overcome, like an inspector general or a freethinking Republican senator. Members of Congress can be targeted for primaries, and inspectors general can be fired; under the same mentality, reporters need to be excluded and their bosses subjected to litigation."
Opinion | Dead Athletes. Empty Stands. Billions to Keep Horse Racing Alive.,['Noah Shachtman'],2025-02-28,"One by one, the horses trot up the ramp and onto the track, pulling single-seat chariots behind them. Their drivers, dressed in garish green and bright pink silks, hop into position. Together, they begin to build up speed as they head into the setting sun. The clip-clop of their hooves hitting the track rises to a cacophony. “And they’re off,” the announcer says. The gates swing forward, and the race begins.

Back in the day, when horse racing was the only legal form of gambling in New York State, 20,000 or more people would jam the stands at Yonkers Raceway, cheering wildly as the standardbreds ran their mile-long harness race. But on this day, despite the beautiful July weather, just a few dozen spectators hang around, slumped into faded orange seats along a chain-link fence. Even with online betting, the racetrack takes in less than one-fortieth of what it would have at the sport’s peak. So the horses take their two laps, head back down the runway and exit the track to something near silence.

It’s a lonely time to be a racing fan. For those who own the horses, though, things aren’t so bad. Payouts for winners — the purses — are tremendous, bringing in investors with “both fists full of money,” said Joe Faraldo, the president of the Standardbred Owners Association of New York. Yonkers has purses that are among the largest of any racetrack of its kind, and it still has millions of dollars left over.

If that doesn’t seem to add up, blame a strange and very lucrative arrangement crafted by interests in the horse racing industry (which includes harness racing and its higher-profile sister sport, thoroughbred racing). Back in 2001, when New York State agreed to hand out new licenses to operate slot machines, the racing crowd won an agreement that a chunk of the proceeds would go to them."
Jury Convicts Landlord in Fatal Stabbing of Palestinian American Boy,"['Robert Chiarito', 'Mitch Smith', 'More About Mitch Smith']",2025-02-28,"A jury in suburban Chicago convicted a man on Friday on murder and hate crime charges in the fatal stabbing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy who lived at his property. The killing, which took place days after Hamas attacked Israel in 2023, was fueled by anti-Muslim hate, the authorities said.

The defendant, Joseph M. Czuba, 73, faces up to life in prison when he is sentenced.

The attack on Wadee Alfayoumi, a kindergartner who loved Legos and soccer, drew international attention and left many members of Illinois’s large Palestinian and Muslim communities frightened and angry. Some leaders in those communities connected the attack to rhetoric used by some American politicians and media personalities that they said dehumanized Palestinians.

Wadee and his mother, Hanan Shaheen, who was wounded in the attack, had lived for two years in rented rooms in Mr. Czuba’s home in Plainfield Township, Ill., about 40 miles southwest of Chicago.

After the violence in the Middle East began, Ms. Shaheen told the jury, the relationship with her landlord suddenly soured. She said Mr. Czuba began making hateful statements about Muslims and demanded that Ms. Shaheen and her young son move out."

The arraignment of the drug lord, Rafael Caro Quintero, a founding member of the Sinaloa Cartel, came a day after he was transferred to the United States from Mexico in a move that potentially signaled a new era of cooperation between the two countries.

Mr. Caro Quintero was arraigned in Federal District Court in Brooklyn along with Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, a former leader of the Juarez Cartel.

Mr. Caro Quintero, 72, was charged in a superseding indictment in 2020 with smuggling thousands of kilograms of illegal drugs across the U.S. border as well as with a four-decade effort to murder his rivals. Mr. Carrillo Fuentes, 62, was charged in a separate indictment with similar crimes from 1990 to 2014. Both pleaded not guilty and were ordered held without bail."
The First Black Leader of Virginia Military Institute Is Ousted,"['Stephanie Saul', 'More About Stephanie Saul']",2025-02-28,"The board of Virginia Military Institute voted on Friday against extending the contract of Major General Cedric T. Wins, the college’s first Black superintendent.

The school’s board of visitors, which voted 10-6 not to extend General Wins’s contract, did not give an official reason for the decision, which was made after a closed session that lasted more than two hours.

The move followed years of pushback from conservative alumni of the college who had objected to what they called General Wins’s “woke” efforts to increase campus diversity. And it followed accusations from a Virginia state senator that the effort to remove him was racially motivated.

The school is the oldest state-supported military college in the country, and all students participate in reserve officers training, a pathway to leadership roles in the U.S. military. General Wins, a V.M.I. alumnus, was appointed to the job in 2021, although he began on an interim basis the previous year. He was responsible for removing the statue of Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, a Confederate general, that had been prominently positioned on campus."

News of the child’s death comes even as the Trump administration has canceled at least four of the five contracts with organizations that helped manage the outbreak. It also placed the manager of the Ebola response at U.S.A.I.D. on administrative leave.

Uganda’s Ministry of Health informed U.S. officials of the death on Thursday. The confirmed case has not yet been announced by the Ugandan government nor the World Health Organization, but federal officials involved in the response alerted the White House on Thursday night.

"Zelenskyy leaves White House early after fiery meeting with Trump, who claims Ukrainian leader isn’t ready for peace – live","['Léonie Chao-Fong', 'Jakub Krupa']",2025-02-28,"From 2h ago 18.43 GMT Trump-Zelenskyy talks cut short after heated exchanges in Oval Office - summary Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s visit to the White House has been cut short after he got into a heated exchange with US president Donald Trump and vice-president JD Vance , who accused him of “disrespectful” behaviour during their talks in the Oval Office.

In a social media update, Trump said he has determined that Zelenskyy “is not ready for peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations”, and said the Ukrainian leader “disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office”. “He can come back when he is ready for peace,” he added.

In their earlier talks, Trump repeatedly told Zelenskyy that he was “gambling with the lives of millions, with the third world war”, and told him to stop holding out for further security guarantees saying “you’re either going to make a deal or we are out”.

Trump appeared to draw false equivalence between the two sides of the war and positioning himself “ for both Ukraine and Russia” as he pursues a peace deal, in stark contrast to Zelenskyy’s comments about Putin as a “killer” and “terrorist” who invaded Ukraine, and with whom he was not ready to compromise on the Ukrainian territory.

The pair repeatedly clashed over their view of Russia and the negotiations, as well as the extent of the European support for Ukraine.

JD Vance also falsely accused Zelenskyy for not thanking the US for its support and “campaigning for the opposition in October,” instead of showing “words of appreciation for the US and the president who is trying to save your country.”

Zelenskyy has left the White House moments ago, with the press conference between the two leaders, where they were expected to sign a deal on minerals, also cancelled. 8:25 In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – video Share Updated at 19.04 GMT

"Ukraine ‘gambling with world war three’, Trump tells Zelenskyy in fiery meeting",['Andrew Roth'],2025-02-28,"US military support for Ukraine hangs in the balance and talks over a minerals deal have collapsed following a disastrous White House summit in which Donald Trump warned Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he was “gambling with world war three” and told the Ukrainian president to come back “when he is ready for peace”.

Zelenskyy left the White House early and a press conference to announce the minerals deal was cancelled after Trump gave Zelenskyy a dressing-down that followed an ambush led by Vice-President JD Vance to shatter the fragile relationship between the two leaders.

The US president received the Ukrainian president on Friday to discuss a controversial mineral resources deal that Trump has said is the first step toward a ceasefire agreement that he is seeking to broker between Russia and Ukraine.

But the meeting on Friday degenerated after Zelenskyy suggested that Vance, a skeptic of US support for Ukraine, should come to the country to see the destruction from the invasion and that Russia was responsible for the continued fighting.

The meeting had been due to continue behind closed doors, but was cut short after the open display of antagonism in the Oval Office.

Soon afterwards, Trump released a statement in which he suggested that the two had not signed the minerals agreement.

“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” he said. “I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

During the public part of the meeting, Trump and Vance took turns to berate Zelenskyy, with Vance accusing him of carrying out “publicity tours” and Trump telling him: “You’re not really in a good position right now.”

At one point he demanded: “Have you said ‘thank you’ once?”

Picking up the theme Trump told Zelenskyy: “Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”

Trump then delivered Zelenskyy an ultimatum, telling him that Ukraine must either “make a deal or we are out” – suggesting the US could walk away from negotiations and cut off support to Kyiv more than three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion.

“Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. We’re trying to solve a problem,” Trump continued. “You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good … You don’t have the cards right now with us, you’ll start having problems right now.”

Trump also told Zelenskyy that “Putin went through a hell of a lot with me” over the impeachment scandal during his first term in office. “He wants to make a deal,” said Trump. “I don’t know if you can make a deal.”

At one point in the exchange, the Ukrainian ambassador to Washington appeared to be holding her head in her hands.

“The problem is, I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think he’d be a tough guy without the United States and your people are very brave,” Trump said. “But you’re either going to make a deal or we’re out, and if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s going to be pretty.”

Trump ended the meeting by saying that Zelenskyy was not “acting thankful” and “that’s not a nice thing”.

“This is going to be great television,” he concluded.

Russian officials reacted with glee to the extraordinary scene, while Ukraine’s European allies expressed support for Kyiv.

Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president, said Zelenskiy had got a “solid slap” from Trump in what he described as “a brutal dressing-down in the Oval Office”.

The European foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that Europe would step up its support for Ukraine “so that they can continue to fight back the agressor.” In an indirect rebuke to Trump, she said: “Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.”

European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, praised Zelenskyy. “Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless,” she posted on X. “We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.”

Jonas Gahr, Norway’s prime minister, described the episode as “serious and disheartening”, adding: “That Trump accuses Zelenskyy of gambling with world war three is deeply unreasonable and a statement I distance myself from.”

The French president, Emanuel Macron, told reporters: “Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine is the aggressed people … These are simple things, but they’re good to remember at times like these.”

Pedro Sanchez, Spain’s prime minister, who pledged €1bn (roughly $1bn) of aid in a visit to Kyiv this week wrote on X: “Ukraine, Spain stands with you.”

After the meeting Zelenskyy expressed his thanks to Trump, Congress and the American people, posting: “Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.” He also cancelled public events which had been scheduled for Friday.



The personal relationship between Trump and Zelenskyy has been strained since Trump’s previous administration, when he was impeached (though not convicted and removed from office) on the grounds that he had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate business dealings involving Joe Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine.

But Friday marked a true low point in the relationship with the public blow-up coming as Ukraine is desperate for foreign military aid and international support to keep the country afloat amid its grinding defense from the Russian invasion.

Zelenskyy arrived in Washington on Friday after several weeks of tense negotiations in which he alleged that the US was pressuring him to sign a deal that it would take “10 generations to pay back”.

Trump has said that he wants the US to be repaid for providing military aid to Ukraine, but commentators have suggested that the deal looks more like a shakedown at Ukraine’s most vulnerable moment.

The deal provides a general framework for a joint investment fund that will take in revenues from the sale of Ukrainian deposits of graphite, lithium, rare earth metals, and oil and gas. But many of those resources are in areas close to the frontlines, and it is unlikely to provide the hundreds of billions of dollars that the US says it wants to recoup from its military aid to Ukraine.

Neither does it contain specific security guarantees that Ukrainian officials have sought during the negotiations, which have gone back and forth since the deal was first proposed by the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, during a visit to Kyiv earlier this month.

During a meeting with the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, on Thursday, Trump had suggested that the American workers sent to mine Ukraine’s natural resources could serve as a “backstop”, a deterrent to further Russian aggression if a deal is made.

“We’ll have a lot of people working and so in that sense, it’s very good,” Trump said on Thursday. “It’s a backstop. You could say, I don’t think anybody’s going to play around if we’re there with a lot of workers and having to do with rare earths and other things which we need for our country.”

The New York Times’ chief White House correspondent called it “one of the most dramatic moments ever to play out in public in the Oval Office”, while the New Yorker’s Susan Glasser described it as “the most shocking behavior by Trump and Vance I’ve ever seen in the Oval Office. An ambush.”

Even as Zelenskyy arrived at the White House, Trump sought to physically dominate the Ukrainian leader, telling reporters that Zelenskyy, who was wearing a black turtleneck, was “all dressed up”. Zelenskyy has not appeared in public in a suit since the Russian full-scale invasion three years ago, preferring to wear military-style clothing instead. Trump has complained about the Ukrainian leader’s style of dress.

Zelenskyy met with US lawmakers earlier on Friday. “An important visit to the United States,” he wrote of his meetings with a bipartisan delegation from the US Senate. “Our discussions focused on the continued military assistance for Ukraine, relevant legislative initiatives, my meeting with President Trump, efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace, our vision for ending the war, and the importance of robust security guarantees.”

Earlier on Friday, the White House removed a reporter from the Russian state news agency Tass, saying the outlet was not on the approved media list for Trump’s meeting with Zelenskyy."
‘Dummies for Putin’: Democrats defend Zelenskyy after ‘shameful’ Trump meeting,['Léonie Chao-Fong'],2025-02-28,"Democratic lawmakers rushed to defend Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the Ukrainian leader was publicly berated by Donald Trump in a disastrous Oval Office meeting.

The US president accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with world war three” while his vice-president, JD Vance, called the Ukrainian leader “disrespectful”, before cutting short talks aimed at kicking off the process of ending Kyiv’s three-year war with Russia.

Zelenskyy abruptly left the White House soon after without signing a rare critical minerals deal with the US that Trump has said is the first step toward a ceasefire agreement that he is seeking to broker between Russia and Ukraine.

Democratic senators came to Zelenskyy’s defense in statements condemning Trump and Vance’s “shameful” and “disgraceful” treatment of the Ukrainian leader.

“Every time I’ve met with President Zelenskyy, he’s thanked the American people for our strong support,” Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, wrote on X. “We owe him our thanks for leading a nation fighting on the front lines of democracy – not the public berating he received at the White House.”

Adam Schiff, the California senator, said: ““A hero and a coward are meeting in the Oval Office today. And when the meeting is over, the hero will return home to Ukraine.”

Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, said: “What an utter embarrassment for America. This whole sad scene.” The Arizona senator Ruben Gallego added: “This is a disgrace.”

Senator Chris Van Hollen from Maryland also described the scenes in the Oval Office as “beyond disgraceful”. The Illinois senator Dick Durbin added: “The people of Ukraine and President Zelenskyy deserve an apology.”

“Trump and Vance berating Zelenskyy – putting on a show of lies and misinformation that would make Putin blush – is an embarrassment for America and a betrayal of our allies,” Durbin said. “They’re popping champagne in the Kremlin.”

Trump and Vance “are doing Putin’s dirty work”, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said after the calamitous meeting, adding that his party will “never stop fighting for freedom and democracy”.

Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic senator from Rhode Island, also accused Trump and Vance of “acting like ventriloquist dummies for Putin”.

Whitehouse was part of a bipartisan group of senators who met with Zelenskyy earlier in the morning before his meeting with the president. The Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said the hour-long discussion showed “strong bipartisan support in the Senate for Ukraine’s freedom and democracy”.

Klobuchar later addressed Vance directly in a social media post saying that Zelenskyy had thanked the US “over and over again” both privately and publicly.

“Our country thanks HIM and the Ukrainian patriots who have stood up to a dictator, buried their own & stopped Putin from marching right into the rest of Europe,” she wrote. “Shame on you,” she said, referring to Vance.

Tina Smith, another Democratic senator from Minnesota, called on her Republican colleagues to “speak out” in the name of “patriotism”. “Once, we fought tyrants. Today Trump and Vance are bending America’s knee,” she said.

But Republican senators rushed to defend Trump, describing the president’s exchange with Zelenskyy as evidence that he was “putting America first”.

Mike Lee, a Utah Republican senator, thanked Trump and Vance “for standing up to our country and putting America first”. The Indiana Republican senator Jim Banks also thanked Trump for “standing up for America”.

“[Zelenskyy] ungratefully expects us to bankroll and escalate another forever war–all while disrespecting the President,” Banks wrote on X. “The entitlement is insulting to working Americans.”"

Anneliese Dodds resigns over Keir Starmer’s decision to cut aid budget,['Pippa Crerar'],2025-02-28,"Anneliese Dodds, the international development minister, has quit her post over Keir Starmer’s decision to slash the international aid budget by almost half to pay for an increase in defence spending, warning it could enable Russia and China to further their global influence.

The senior Labour MP, who attended cabinet, predicted that the UK pulling back from development would bolster Moscow, which has already been aggressively increasing its presence worldwide, as well as encourage Beijing’s attempts to rewrite global rules.

Her departure, just hours after Starmer returned from a widely lauded trip to Washington for crucial talks with Donald Trump on Ukraine, came as a blow to the prime minister as concerns grew that the aid cut could damage the UK’s national security interests.

In a further setback to Starmer’s commitment to maintain development spending in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, Dodds predicted the government would find it impossible with the diminished budget, which will fall by about £6bn by 2027.

She said she firmly believed, however, that Starmer was right to increase defence spending, because the postwar consensus had “come crashing down” after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

She recognised there were “not easy paths” to boosting defence spending, saying she had been prepared for some cuts to the aid budget to help pay for the plan to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 – and an ambition to hit 3% in the next parliament.

But the former shadow chancellor said she believed Starmer’s 3% ambition “may only be the start”, given the tumultuous global picture, and urged the government to look at ways of raising the money other than through cutting departmental budgets, including looking again at borrowing rules and taxation.

There is understood to be a growing sense in the cabinet that the government should not let adherence to the fiscal rules scupper its wider agenda, with further painful departmental cuts on the cards in June as Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, attempts to balance the books.

Starmer replied with his own letter several hours after Dodds announced her resignation, in which he praised the departing minister but defended his decision to cut the aid budget.

Jenny Chapman has been appointed the new minister for international development, Downing Street said.

Cabinet ministers are among those who voiced concern over plans to cut aid spending by 46%, from 0.56% of gross national income to 0.3%, after Trump’s own drastic cuts to the US aid budget. In a cabinet meeting, several spoke of the risk of unintended consequences.

David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said earlier this month that the US’s plan to cut aid funding could be a “big strategic mistake” that would allow China to step into the gap and extend its global influence. Starmer has been accused of pandering to the US president.

Dodds, the MP for Oxford East, said she was told about the decision by Starmer only on Monday, but delayed resigning so as not to overshadow the prime minister’s trip to Washington to make the case to Trump for security guarantees for Ukraine.

Starmer made his surprise announcement in the Commons, telling MPs that Britain would “fight for peace in Europe” with a generational increase in defence spending.

The announcement, two days before the prime minister was due to meet Trump, raised immediate concerns that he was following the US’s lead and prompted fury from aid groups, who said it could cost lives in countries that relied on UK support.

Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British army, said the decision to cut foreign aid was a “strategic mistake” that would ultimately add to the burden on Britain’s armed forces, and risked making the UK “weaker not stronger”.

Dodds, in her letter to the prime minister, wrote: “Undoubtedly the postwar global order has come crashing down. I believe that we must increase spending on defence as a result; and know that there are no easy paths to doing so.

“I stood ready to work with you to deliver that increased spending, knowing some might well have had to come from overseas development assistance [ODA]. I also expected we would collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, as other nations are doing.

“Even 3% may only be the start, and it will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, when strategic decisions for the sake of our country’s security cannot be ducked.”

Dodds, who was also a minister for women, was sceptical about Starmer’s promise to maintain aid funding for Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, as well as for vaccination, climate and rules-based systems.

Officials have said that the portion of the development budget going on asylum-seeker accommodation – which stands at almost a third – would eventually be freed up for aid.

But Dodds wrote: “It will be impossible to maintain these priorities given the depth of the cut; the effect will be far greater than presented, even if assumptions made about reducing asylum costs hold true.”

She cautioned about the effect on Britain’s national security and global influence as hostile countries moved into the breach.

“The cut will also likely lead to a UK pullout from numerous African, Caribbean and western Balkan nations at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence,” she said. “All this while China is seeking to rewrite global rules, and when the climate crisis is the biggest security threat of them all.

“Ultimately, these cuts will remove food and healthcare from desperate people – deeply harming the UK’s reputation. I know you have been clear that you are not ideologically opposed to international development. But the reality is that this decision is already being portrayed as following in President Trump’s slipstream of cuts to USAid.”

In reply, Starmer wrote: “Overseas development is vitally important, and I am proud of what we have done. The UK will still be providing significant humanitarian and development support, and we will continue to protect vital programmes – including in the world’s worst conflict zones of Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan.

“The decision I have taken on ODA was a difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly. We will do everything we can to return to a world where that is not the case and to rebuild a capability on development.

“However, protecting our national security must always be the first duty of any government and I will always act in the best interests of the British people.”

Sarah Champion, the Labour chair of the Commons international development committee, posted on X: “What else could she do? She knows these cuts are unworkable. Honourable as always, she’s done right by her department and right by the PM by not resigning before DC visit. Deep shame for development where she was respected.”

The Conservative former aid secretary Andrew Mitchell said Dodds had “done the right thing” by resigning, adding: “Labour’s disgraceful and cynical actions demean the Labour party’s reputation as they balance the books on the backs of the poorest people in the world. Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle.”

Romilly Greenhill, the chief executive of Bond, the umbrella organisation for aid charities, said: “This will be a huge loss. It is clear from the devastating UK aid cuts announced this week, which must be reversed, that the government is trying to step back from its development ambitions.”"
Rage in Greece as second anniversary of train disaster prompts mass protests,['Helena Smith'],2025-02-28,"Two years to the day since 57 people died and dozens were injured in Greece’s worst train crash in history, hundreds of thousands of protesters filled plazas around the country and a general strike paralysed the transport network in an outpouring of anger over the government’s handling of the tragedy.

By 11am on Friday, more than 100,000 people had already gathered in Syntagma Square in Athens. Thousands who could not get to the area due to packed metro trains instead vented their anger outside stations in the capital’s suburbs.

The huge crowds in Athens and elsewhere reflected multiple opinion polls indicating that most Greeks believed officials concealed vital evidence after the crash, slowing down an investigation that is still incomplete.

“I think all of us wanted to say: ‘You have to take responsibility,’” said 27-year-old Paris Economou, a drama student who attended the Athens demonstration.

“Young people like me needlessly lost their lives,” he said. “And it boils down to this: either the state is so inadequate it can’t run a modern railway system, or we should believe the conspiracy theories and everything they say about a cover-up. One or the other is true.”

As Economou spoke, the crowd dispersed as the otherwise peaceful protest was eclipsed by the eruption of violence between rock-throwing youths and riot police firing teargas. A young woman dressed in black, her head covered with a headscarf, stopped to show the cardboard placard she was carrying, which bore the message: “It was state murder.”

On the night of 28 February 2023 two trains collided in the gorge of Tempe in central Greece: an intercity Thessaloniki-bound passenger train that had set off from Athens crammed with students, and a freight train that was moving north to south. The head-on collision was of such ferocity that the front carriages of the two locomotives exploded into a fireball that instantly incinerated several of the victims. The remains of many were never found.

Questions over what the cargo train was carrying has fuelled much of the public outrage. This week, a 178-page report, released by an independent investigative committee, did not exclude its wagons containing highly flammable chemicals, citing “the possible presence” of an “unknown fuel” at the site of the crash.

The relatives of the victims, who have spent two years trying to get to the bottom of the tragedy, have for many become potent symbols of the public desire for transparency and demand for answers.

Poll after poll has agreed: with a trial yet to begin and no government official ever convicted, Greeks have lost trust in public institutions and their judicial system. “That’s why today’s were the biggest protests this country has witnessed since the collapse in 1974 of the military dictatorship,” said Petros Constantinou, a prominent figure in the leftwing activist movement who had spent days marshalling support for the rallies.

Not since he first won office in July 2019 has the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, a former banker, confronted such unrest.

Anger over the response to the crash – not least the controversial decision to rapidly clean up the site and remove debris that included vital evidence and human remains – has been exacerbated by the perceived and growing sense of a government cover-up. Within days of the crash, in a move that has yet to be fully explained, authorities rushed to gravel over and cement the area.

On Friday the embattled leader admitted that “nothing will be as it was before”.

“That night we saw the worst face of the country in the national mirror,” he wrote in an online post. “Fatal human mistakes bonded with chronic state insufficiencies and violently derailed our certainties.”

Until recently, Mitsotakis has proved to be adept at handling crises – a talent that has helped reinforce a rare sense of political stability in a nation that for years was roiled by economic and social crisis.

But Friday’s outpouring of dissent, with demonstrations taking place across time zones in more than 270 cities in Greece and abroad, has piled on the pressure as never before. It is pressure that will grow when the main opposition Pasok party leader, Nikos Androulakis, submits a vote of no confidence in the government next week.

Among those who took to the streets on Friday were a sizeable cohort of once fervent Mitsotakis supporters. They, too, are now united with opponents of the ruling New Democracy party in believing that the tragedy – and its fallout – is indicative of everything that is wrong with their country. “A lot of us are very disappointed. Tempe is just the tip of the iceberg,” said one veteran conservative who had once held a public position and preferred to go unnamed.

Addressing the crowd from a podium in front of the Greek parliament, Maria Karystianou, whose daughter was killed in the disaster, and who heads the Tempe Victims Association, struck a chord that he and so many others believe.

“Every day, the monster of corrupt power stands before us,” she said. “You have insulted and dishonoured our dead. The bodies and bones of our children remain unburied and hidden. You have committed the ultimate sacrilege, and you will receive what is due through the vengeance of the dead.”

"Gene Hackman and wife suffered no external trauma, first autopsy results show","['Dani Anguiano', 'Ed Pilkington']",2025-02-28,"Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, suffered no external trauma, the initial results of autopsies have found, as the mystery over the couple’s deaths at home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, remains unanswered.

The Oscar-winning actor, who graced the silver screen for more than 60 years, and his classical pianist wife were found dead at their home under suspicious circumstances. Maintenance workers found the couple’s bodies at their home on Wednesday, along with one of their three German shepherd dogs, who was also found dead.

The Santa Fe sheriff’s office gave the first insights into the autopsies on the deceased, the full results of which may take several weeks. In a statement, the department said that preliminary findings showed “no external trauma to either individual”, and “there were no apparent signs of foul play”.

The statement added that the cause of death had not yet been determined, and that the official results of the postmortem exam and toxicology reports remain pending.

The suddenly discovered deaths have stunned movie fans around the world and sent shockwaves through Hollywood and New Mexico, where the couple lived for decades.

The Santa Fe International Film Festival organization said it was “deeply saddened”.

“Not only was Gene one of the greatest actors of his generation but he and Betsy were members of our community here in Santa Fe,” a statement said.

New Mexico’s state senate held a moment of silence at the state capitol in the historic city, with one lawmaker stating: “We were lucky to call him a New Mexican.”

In downtown Santa Fe there were no signs of any immediate tributes visible among the traditional adobe buildings of the area, hailing or mourning the famous residents, and the streets were quiet on Friday morning under characteristic brilliant blue skies and bright sunshine.

Meanwhile the sheriff of Santa Fe county, Adan Mendoza, had also revealed that the couple had been dead for “quite a while” before they were found. The two maintenance workers who made the grim discovery said the last time they had been in touch with Hackman and Arakawa was two weeks previously.

Early on Friday Mendoza told the Today Show on NBC TV that it was difficult to put a timeline on how long the couple had been dead. But he added: “It appears, several days, possibly even up to a couple weeks.”

The possibility that several days might have passed before the couple’s bodies were discovered chimes with an affidavit in which a sheriff disclosed that Arakawa’s body “showed obvious signs of death, body decomposition, bloating in her face and mummification in both hands and feet”. Mummification occurs when dead tissue dries and hardens over time.

The sheriff’s office has reported that when the deceased were found the front door was open, although there were no signs of foul play, and no obvious evidence of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning. But the scene was strange enough that the sheriff’s office sought a search warrant on Wednesday evening.

Hackman, 95, appeared to have fallen in an entryway, a deputy said, and a cane was found nearby. Arakawa, 65, was found in an upstairs bathroom with an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on a nearby countertop. The dead German shepherd was found in a bathroom closet.

“There was no indication of a struggle,” Mendoza said. “There was no indication of anything that was missing from the home or disturbed … you know, that would be indication that there was a crime that had occurred.”

Hackman and Arakawa appeared to have suddenly fallen to the floor and neither showed signs of blunt force trauma, an affidavit said. Mendoza said two other dogs were found alive, and that those dogs were not in a crate and were able to move freely in and out of the house by a pet door.

Authorities were contacted after a worker performing pest control came across their open door but was unable to get in touch with the couple and dispatched security in the area to check on them.

“I think we just found two or one deceased person[s] inside a house for purchase here,” a caller told 911. “I’m not inside the house. It’s closed. It’s locked. I can’t go in. But I see them. She’s lying face down on the floor from the window.”

Hackman, a former marine known for his raspy voice, appeared in more than 80 films, as well as on television and the stage during a lengthy career that started in the early 1960s.

He earned his first Oscar nomination for his breakout role as the brother of bank robber Clyde Barrow in 1967’s Bonnie and Clyde. He was also nominated for best supporting actor in 1970 for I Never Sang for My Father.

His role as Popeye Doyle, the rumpled New York detective chasing international drug dealers in director William Friedkin’s thriller The French Connection, brought him stardom and a best actor Academy Award.

He also won a best supporting actor Oscar in 1992 for his role as a mean sheriff in the Clint Eastwood western Unforgiven, and was nominated for an Academy Award for his turn as an FBI agent in the 1988 historical drama Mississippi Burning.

Since the 1980s, Hackman had lived near Santa Fe, a charming arts town – in 2005 it was recognized as a Unesco “creative city” with a thriving tourism industry. It has become well-known in part due to the famed artists and writers that have called it home, including George RR Martin and Cormac McCarthy.

Hackman became well-established in the community, and for many decades could be seen making his way around town. Between 1997 and 2004, he served on the board of trustees for the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum. Speaking at the grand opening of the museum, he said: “In the 10 years I’ve lived here, I’ve been taken with the excitement and indomitable spirit of this place.”

The couple lived in a gated community just outside Santa Fe.

“He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa,” his daughters and granddaughter said in a statement on Thursday.

“We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss.”

Pope Francis suffers ‘breathing crisis’ making condition suddenly worse,['Angela Giuffrida'],2025-02-28,"Pope Francis has suffered an “isolated breathing crisis” which caused him to vomit, provoking a “sudden worsening” of his respiratory condition, the Vatican said.

The episode happened on Friday afternoon after the pontiff, 88, spent the morning alternating “respiratory training” with prayer in the chapel at Rome’s Gemelli hospital, where he has been battling pneumonia for two weeks.

The Vatican said in its evening update that the pope inhaled the vomit, leading to the “sudden worsening” of his respiratory condition.

He was then administered “non-invasive mechanical ventilation” to help him to breathe, which had “a good response”, the Vatican added.

Francis remained “alert and well-oriented” and is continuing his treatments. His doctors’ prognosis remains guarded.

A Vatican official said the breathing crisis on Friday did not last for long and that his doctors were expected to need 24-48 hours to assess how the event would affect his clinical condition.

The episode came after three days in which the pontiff’s health had shown “slight” improvements, meaning his situation was no longer considered to be critical.

On Wednesday, a CT scan of the pontiff’s chest “showed a normal evolution” of the inflammation in his lungs, while the “mild kidney insufficiency”, which was diagnosed on Sunday, had resolved.

It is unclear how long he will remain in hospital. The Vatican said earlier on Friday that Francis would not be leading the church service on 5 March to mark the beginning of Lent.

Francis was admitted to hospital on 14 February and was subsequently diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and pneumonia in both lungs.

He is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed while he was training to be a priest in his native Argentina.

Nightly prayer vigils for the pope’s health are continuing to take place at St Peter’s Basilica as well as in towns and cities across Italy and abroad.

Vigils have also been held outside the Gemelli, which has long been the preferred hospital for pontiffs.

The pope has suffered from ill health in recent years. He was admitted to hospital in March 2023 for what was eventually diagnosed as pneumonia. He also underwent a colon operation in June 2021. The pontiff has often been seen using a wheelchair or a walking stick as a result of sciatic nerve pain and a knee problem.

Before his hospital admission, the pope maintained an intense schedule, especially with events related to the Catholic jubilee year."
Israel proposes Gaza plan that gives it tighter military control than before war,['Julian Borger'],2025-02-28,"The Israeli military has presented the UN and aid organisations with a plan for running Gaza that involves Israel having tighter control than it did before the war, according to humanitarian officials, casting doubt on whether Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has any intention of carrying out a military withdrawal.

At meetings with UN representatives on Wednesday and with officials from other agencies on Thursday, Cogat, the army unit given the task of delivering aid to the occupied territories, outlined a scheme of distributing supplies through tightly managed logistics hubs to vetted Palestinian recipients.

The blueprint appears to be a version of a scheme tried more than a year ago in Gaza, known as “humanitarian bubbles”, involving aid distributions from small, highly controlled areas that would expand over time. But the experiment was abandoned after a few trials in northern Gaza.

It has been revived by Cogat at a time when Israel is negotiating the potential start of a second phase of the January ceasefire agreement, which is supposed to include the full withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from the Gaza Strip. The Cogat plan instead involves a tightening of Israel’s grip on day-to-day life in the Palestinian territory.

According to aid sources briefed on the plan, the “humanitarian hubs” themselves could be secured by private security contractors, but they would be located in areas “under full IDF control”.

The only entrance to Gaza through which aid would be allowed under the plan would be the Kerem Shalom crossing, controlled by Israel. The Rafah crossing, between Egypt and Gaza, would be permanently closed.

Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) allowed to operate in Gaza would have to be registered in Israel, and all staff working for them or for UN agencies would have to be vetted.

As aid would only be allowed through an Israeli crossing and not through Rafah, it would make operating in Gaza all but impossible for the UN relief agency for Palestinian Refugees (Unrwa) – by far the biggest aid organisation in Gaza – which has been banned by Israel.

Aid officials familiar with the Cogat briefing said the plan was presented as an established fact, with Israeli officials claiming it already had full US support and would therefore be hard for the UN to resist.

The scheme envisages a Gaza in which basic necessities are distributed to approved Palestinians at limited distribution points under tight Israeli control. It makes no mention of Donald Trump’s plan for the US to take ownership of the Gaza Strip and for the territory to be emptied of its Palestinian inhabitants.

Cogat did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Its presentation of the scheme comes as Arab governments discuss their own plan for Gaza’s future. A meeting in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, of representatives from Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf states on 21 February endorsed an Egyptian-designed $53bn reconstruction plan lasting three to five years, starting with the establishment of safe zones of tents and mobile homes for people to live in during reconstruction.

The proposal is due to be presented to an emergency summit of the Arab League on Tuesday in Cairo.

“The Cogat plan is meant to be a spoiler, an alternative to the Arab plan,” an aid worker in Jerusalem said.

In January 2024, the IDF carried out trials of “humanitarian bubbles” in three areas of northern Gaza. Selected Palestinians such as community elders were to administer the distribution of food and other basic supplies, but the plan never got off the ground. It was hard to find local volunteers prepared to work with the Israelis and Hamas killed some of the local people who were co-opted into the experiment.

“The bubble approach, which was rejected from the beginning of the war, has all kinds of serious implications since the Israelis will control each single supply coming in,” Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, said.

Shawa said it would be an extension of the restrictive aid regime currently overseen by the IDF. Under the ceasefire, the flow of humanitarian assistance entering Gaza has reverted to its prewar level of 400 to 600 trucks a day, but Shawa says Israel has not delivered the number of tents promised, when children have been freezing to death.

Unrwa reported that six infants died from exposure to cold on Monday and Tuesday this week in the Gaza Strip.

Shawa said the IDF was also preventing water tankers from entering, as well as notebooks and crayons intended for the improvised school classes being taught under canvas, on the grounds that such materials were “dual use”.

“They want to control the ABC of the lives of Palestinians,” he said."
"Meta apologises over flood of gore, violence and dead bodies on Instagram",['Dan Milmo'],2025-02-28,"Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has apologised after Instagram users were subjected to a flood of violence, gore, animal abuse and dead bodies on their Reels feeds.

Users reported the footage after an apparent malfunction in Instagram’s algorithm, which curates what people see on the app.

Reels is a feature on the social media platform that allows users to share short videos, similar to TikTok.

An Instagram forum on Reddit, the online discussion platform, contained posts from users referencing the graphic material that had appeared in their feeds in midweek.

One user on the subreddit wrote: “I just saw at least 10 people die on my reels.”

There were also references by users to a video of a man being crushed by an elephant. Others flagged footage of a man being dismembered by a helicopter and a video where “a guy put his face into boiling oil”. Several users posted videos of their Reels feeds dominated by “sensitive content” screens that are designed to shield users from graphic material.

A list of violent content on one user’s feed, published by the tech news site 404, included: a man being set on fire; a man shooting a cashier at point-blank range; videos from an account called “PeopleDeadDaily”; and a pig being beaten with a wrench. The user in question had a biking-related Instagram account, 404 Media reported.

Another Reddit user wrote: “For the past 24 hours, it feels like Instagram’s algorithm has gone rogue. My feed is absolutely packed with violent Reels – like, one after the other.

“It’s like Instagram is now trying to make me question if I accidentally followed a ‘bloodshed and chaos’ account. I get that the platform’s all about ‘engagement’ and ‘trending,’ but did they really think this was the way to get people to scroll more?”

A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said: “We have fixed an error that caused some users to see content on their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended. We apologise for the mistake.”

The error follows recent changes to Meta’s approach to content moderation. However, the company told 404 Media that the deluge of graphic videos was not related to the overhaul of Meta’s content rules, which included removing factcheckers and “dramatically” reducing the amount of censorship on its platforms.

Meta’s content guidelines state the company will remove content that is “particularly violent or graphic” and that some imagery will be shielded by sensitive content screens. In the UK, the Online Safety Act requires social media platforms to take measures to prevent under-18s from seeing material that is harmful to them such as violent, hateful or abusive material, which will include configuring their algorithms to filter out such content.

One internet safety campaign group demanded a “full explanation” of what had happened to Instagram’s algorithm.

The Molly Rose Foundation, set up by the family of the UK teenager Molly Russell, who killed herself in 2017 after viewing distressing content on Instagram, said questions needed to answered about why such graphic content was on the platform in the first place.

“As Instagram rolls back content moderation this is likely to be a sign of things to come,” said Andy Burrows, the foundation’s chief executive. “Meta’s changes will mean this type of content is more freely available and will more often be recommended to appear in user’s feeds.”"
Woman who died after dog attacked her in Bristol named as Morgan Dorsett,['Nadeem Badshah'],2025-02-28,"A 19-year-old woman who died after she was attacked by a dog in Bristol has been named as Morgan Dorsett, police say.

The teenager, from Shropshire, was attacked by a dog, believed to have been an XL bully, inside a flat in Cobhorn Drive in the Hartcliffe area of the city at 7.19pm on Wednesday.

Paramedics and police officers attended but Dorsett died at the scene.

Avon and Somerset police said the dog had been put down and work to confirm the breed continued.

A man and a woman, both in their 20s, who were arrested on suspicion of being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control causing injury resulting in death, and possession of a prohibited breed of dog, have been released on conditional police bail while the investigation continues.

The force added that Dorsett’s family thanked the public for their support and those who had left flowers near the scene, in south Bristol.

At a press conference on Thursday, the neighbourhood inspector Terry Murphy, of Avon and Somerset police, declined to comment on whether the dead woman was living at the address where the attack happened, or if there had been previous police contact with the household.

He said: “Our thoughts, first and foremost, are with the family of the young woman who’s tragically died. They have been updated and will be supported by a family liaison officer. I’d also like to thank the officers and paramedics who attended … and tried to save her life. Support is in place for them.

“A full investigation is now well under way to establish the full circumstances of the events that led to her death.”"
Cuts to UK vaccine funding could lead to ‘huge numbers’ of child deaths overseas,['Peter Walker'],2025-02-28,"Hundreds of thousands of children in the world’s poorest countries will die if the UK cuts back funding for a hugely effective vaccination programme as part of its significant reduction in overseas aid, the Guardian has been told.

According to data collated by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi), to which the UK has previously been one of the main contributors, even a small cut in UK funding would be expected to result in millions fewer vaccinations, leading to huge numbers of preventable deaths.

The projections, put together by aid agencies based on Gavi’s records and seen by the Guardian, will place more pressure on the government over its plan to hugely reduce overseas aid, using the money to spend more on defence, after the resignation in protest on Friday of Anneliese Dodds, the international development minister.

It comes as the head of the British Council, which is partly financed from the aid budget, urged ministers to ensure they did not erode the UK’s diplomatic and cultural soft power.

The projections, dating from before the new cuts, calculated that even if the UK kept its contribution to Gavi steady, rather than a hoped-for increase of 10%, this would lead to the Geneva-based alliance vaccinating 8 million fewer children, about 200,000 of whom would subsequently die.

Aid agencies had expected the UK’s budget for Gavi to be cut even before Tuesday’s announcement on overseas aid, with the money used to spend more on defence. If it was to drop by 40%, the amount overall aid is falling, it would lead to many hundreds of thousands of otherwise preventable deaths.

The Foreign Office says no decision on specific programmes will be taken before next month’s spending review, and pointed to Keir Starmer’s pledge to particularly support vaccination efforts, as well as relief in areas such as Sudan and Gaza. However, aid officials are braced for a potentially significant cut.

While the reduction is from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027, given nearly a third of this is spent on housing asylum seekers in the UK, experts have said the amount spent overseas could end up being as little as 0.23%, the lowest proportion since records began.

This has caused particular alarm given it comes after Donald Trump in effect shut down the United States Agency for International Development (USAid), halting much of its own vaccination work.

The UK has given Gavi more than £2bn over the past four years. The US has also previously been a key funder, along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Aid campaigners argue it has proved to be hugely cost-effective in its work. Gavi’s statistics show that it has vaccinated more than 1.1 billion children across 78 countries in its 25 years of operation, preventing nearly 18m deaths.

“Reducing UK funding for Gavi would be fiscally easy, but disastrous,” one aid agency official said. “It would cost large numbers of lives – there is no way around that.”

A Gavi spokesperson said the alliance was “heartened” to hear Starmer mention vaccination as a priority.

They added: “While we appreciate the competing priorities every country is faced with, any cut to UK funding would have a disastrous effect on Gavi’s work supporting routine immunisation of more than half the world’s children, maintaining global stockpiles of vaccines against diseases like Ebola and cholera, reaching vulnerable communities in humanitarian contexts with vital services, and helping countries and the world quickly respond to outbreaks.”

Doing this would be “reversing years of progress, leaving the world less secure in face of inevitable future emergencies, and setting countries back on their pathway to self-sufficiency”, the spokesperson said.

Also at risk is the British Council, which warned last month it faced potential budget cuts of £250m, which would remove its presence in up to 40 countries, a legacy of commercial interest rates charged on Covid-era loans from the government.

Scott McDonald, the council’s chief executive, said while defence spending was needed, “we must not forget the importance of building alliances and global influence through soft power activity, which supports the UK’s security objectives, through which the British Council has a proven track record in countering disinformation, building media literacy and supporting cohesion”.

It was, he added, “critical that the simultaneous cuts to the aid budget are not delivered in a way that damages the UK’s reputation and soft power”."
Bargain Hunt auctioneer cleared of coercive control and assault allegations,['Nadeem Badshah'],2025-02-28,"The celebrity auctioneer Charles Hanson has been unanimously cleared of coercive control and assault allegations made against him by his wife.

The trial heard allegations that Hanson, 46, put Rebecca Hanson in a headlock while she was pregnant with a baby she later lost, repeatedly “grabbed” her, locked her in a hotel room, pushed her and scratched her as she tried to snatch a mobile phone.

Charles Hanson had denied charges of controlling or coercive behaviour between 2015 and 2023, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault by beating.

The expert on the TV programmes Bargain Hunt and Antiques Road Trip told Derby crown court he was “almost a slave” to his wife, who left him “a beaten and broken man” by controlling him.



The prosecution had previously said WhatsApp messages sent by the defendant to his wife, now 41, amounted to a “set of confessions” to the charges.



In his closing speech to jurors on Wednesday, the crown counsel Stephen Kemp said the messages, including one in which Hanson promised to never again “lay a finger” on his wife, provided a clear picture of the couple’s relationship.



The auctioneer’s counsel, Sasha Wass KC, previously told the trial that Hanson “was not controlled in any sense of the word” and was instead unstable and unhappy and “felt resentful and hard done by” at her husband’s work commitments before their marriage “imploded” in 2023.



Wass had asked the jury in her closing speech to consider whether an incident involving an alleged headlock, which Hanson claims was simply a hug, was “a real incident” that Rebecca Hanson had distorted to “build up a false case” against her husband.



On Friday, the jury foreman returned the not guilty verdicts on charges of coercive and controlling behaviour, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault by beating after a three-week trial.



The celebrity auctioneer’s parents, who were sitting in the public gallery, wept and hugged their son after he was discharged from the dock.



Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom, Hanson said: “I’m delighted that after a year and a half the truth has finally come out. It has been a tormentous time and all I want now is to readjust to what has been such an ordeal.”

Land’s End lighthouse fog alarm sounding every 13 seconds,['Sammy Gecsoyler'],2025-02-28,"The distant sound of a lighthouse can be a part of coastal life that really adds to the maritime ambience.

For those living near Land’s End, however, any sense of whimsy has worn off. A fog alarm at Longships Lighthouse, just off the Cornish headland, has been going off every 13 seconds for the past week.

Local people have been advised to invest in a set of earplugs while visitors heading to the tourist destination said they feared being kept awake at night.

The National Coastwatch Institution (NCI) Gwennap Head, a maritime charity, said on social media that the horn had been sounding “all day, all night” and “a set of earplugs might be a good investment”.

In a statement, it said: “Anyone living in the area may have noticed that, for the past six days, the Longships Lighthouse has been sounding its foghorn every 13 seconds … all day and all night.

“Our watchkeeper has reported this ‘interesting’ occurrence to HM Coastguard Falmouth and they, in turn, have reported it to Trinity House. It has been fed back to us that Trinity House are aware of the problem; apparently, there is a fault in the fog sensing mechanism and they are awaiting delivery of a part to fix it.

“Of course, once the part has arrived, the maintenance crew will still have to wait for calm enough weather conditions to allow them to get out to the lighthouse and install it. In the meantime, a set of earplugs might be a good investment.”

Trinity House, which manages more than 60 lighthouses across the UK, said there was an issue with the “audible hazard warning signal” on Longships, whichit planned to fix.

It told the BBC: “It will likely be an issue with the visibility sensor not functioning as expected. The hazard warning signal indicates diminished visibility in the area, such as fog.”

David Hocking, of Land’s End Landmark, said the continuous beeping was “a bit of a talking point and conversation starter” in the area.

A tourist visiting the spot told the BBC it was “the noisiest sunset I’ve seen so far”. Another said she hoped the alarm would have been “silenced” overnight. “It’s been going for a week I think. This is not normal for Cornwall.”

Another visitor said the alarm was “noisy”, adding that it would “probably keep me awake”, but a visitor staying nearby said they could not hear the noise from their room.

The high-pitched electronic beep, which is usually only heard during foggy conditions, has gone off despite the skies having been fog free this week. The alarm can be heard most clearly at Land’s End, but residents in nearby villages including Sennen and Cape Cornwall have reported hearing it too.

Longships Lighthouse was built in 1875. It is 115ft (35 metres) tall and is located about 1.25 miles (2km) off Land’s End. It was crewed by resident lighthouse-keepers until 1987, when it became automated. Since then it has been monitored and controlled by Trinity House from the company’s planning centre in Harwich, Essex."
‘Rather fraught’: how Starmer’s team laid groundwork for positive Trump talks,['Pippa Crerar'],2025-02-28,"“We’re feeling good, we’re very well prepared,” one senior UK official declared on the eve of Keir Starmer’s highly anticipated first meeting with Donald Trump at the White House. The prime minister had just landed in Washington DC and been driven straight to a glitzy reception at the UK ambassador’s opulent Edwin Lutyens-designed residence.

Under the sparkling crystal chandeliers and among the grand marble columns, his euphoric host, Peter Mandelson, introduced Starmer to guests including the new FBI director, Kush Patel. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham and the New York-based editor Tina Brown were also present.

“I’ve only just arrived but already I can feel there’s real buzz around Washington right now,” Starmer told the gathering. “You can sense that there’s a new leader. He’s a true one-off, a pioneer in business, in politics. Many people love him. Others love to hate him. But to us, he’s just … Peter.”

But alongside the levity there was also apprehension among the prime minister’s most senior advisers at what might unfold the next day, which held probably the most consequential meeting of Starmer’s premiership, and also the most unpredictable.

“We’re well prepared but also aware that absolutely anything could happen. Trump is so mercurial,” a second official said. “So it’s rather fraught.”

The groundwork for the visit had been going on for some time. In May last year, David Lammy made his sixth visit to Washington since becoming shadow foreign secretary, spending several days in the US capital meeting the Democrat and Republican campaign teams.

When he got back to the UK, he wrote a memo for Starmer, then leader of the opposition, sharing how impressed he had been by the professionalism and focus of the Trump campaign. At the top of the page were the words: “The Democrats are in trouble.”

Since then, Starmer and his senior team have been preparing for a Trump presidency, putting personal relationships at the heart of their strategy. In September, by now prime minister, Starmer dined at Trump Tower in New York.

Three months later his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, travelled to the US for talks with his Trump counterpart, Susie Wiles. Others have been out to Washington in recent days, leaving nothing to chance.

“If Donald Trump likes somebody he’s doing business with, it makes all the difference,” one senior government official said. “He likes that Keir is down to earth. It’s important because it means it’s possible for him to raise difficult issues without risk.”

During their meetings, Trump’s warmth towards Starmer was apparent, describing him as a “special man”, lauding the “incredible” and “unprecedented” offer from King Charles of a second state visit, and even lavishing praise on the prime minister’s “beautiful” Surrey accent.

They had not got there by accident. The government’s strategy has been threefold: flatter Trump’s not insubstantial ego; characterise the UK’s “asks” through the prism of how they might benefit America; but also stand up for the British national interest.

As part of the first, there was a conscious decision to “dial down the volume” in public about Trump’s more outrageous public outbursts, whether that was falsely labelling Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator, suggesting making Canada the 51st US state, or sharing an AI video of “Trump Gaza”.

Starmer brought personal gifts with him from the UK. The president’s included a golf cap in his family tartan and some Downing Street golf balls, while his wife, Melania, received a Liberty scarf and No 10 candle. In return, Trump gave the football-mad prime minister a US jersey with his name and the number 10 on the back.

The second part of the UK strategy involved presenting a deal on the Chagos Islands as a national security issue, suggesting a tech-focused trade deal would be an economic boon for the US, and encouraging American security guarantees for Ukraine so that any peace treaty is durable.

The Downing Street team was also aware that to truly earn Trump’s respect, Starmer would have to – in the words of one adviser – “show some balls”, demonstrating that he was willing to stand up for the UK’s national interest.

He did so repeatedly, reminding Trump that Vladimir Putin was the aggressor in Ukraine, challenging JD Vance on free speech in the UK and arguing the case against tariffs. “He tried,” Trump joked with reporters at a press conference later in the opulent east room of the White House when asked about tariffs. “He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.”

While No 10 will have been relieved that the White House visit went without any obvious hitch, in the longer term, was the prime minister’s strategy successful? “I think we’ll have two deals. A deal on ending the war, and I think we’re going to end up with a great trade deal,” Trump concluded.

Starmer left the White House with positive noises on tariffs, although Trump did not rule out imposing them entirely; also the prospect of a tech trade deal, although officials admitted there would have to be policy and regulatory compromises ahead. And the president hinted he could accept the Chagos Islands deal – although some in his administration are vehemently against.

When the prime minister came to the back of the plane on the flight back to London to chat briefly to journalists, he confirmed he was “happy” with how the day had gone, giving a Trump-style thumbs up.

But the prime minister and his senior team know there is a danger that any endorsement from Trump may prove short-lived, and there is always the risk the president could very publicly change his mind. Also, Zelenskyy was due to arrive in Washington on Friday, so the situation in Ukraine could change extremely quickly in either direction.

One Starmer aide said: “I wouldn’t put too much stress on one meeting, what’s important is the process. We’re at the very beginning of that and there are very basic things not yet agreed or defined.”

Chief among those is Starmer’s push for a US military “backstop” to support any European peacekeeping forces that may end up in Ukraine if a peace deal is reached. Trump repeatedly resisted making any sort of commitment. Instead, he suggested that an economic backstop of US civilians working in Ukraine on a multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal would be enough to deter Putin, perhaps also hoping that the vagueness of his position might prevent another Russian attack.

Starmer is trying to keep his eye on the ultimate prize. “When there’s a Trump presidency, the rhetoric is always very destabilising, so we try to zoom out,” an aide said. “The president has been very clear he wants to end the war. That’s all that matters, and we want to help him get there.”"
‘He looks half the man he was’: brother of Israeli hostage on seeing him pleading for release,"['Julian Borger', 'Quique Kierszenbaum']",2025-02-28,"When Hamas brought two captive Israelis to watch Saturday’s release of six of their fellow hostages and then beg for their own liberation, it was purposely jabbing at a deeply painful divide in Israeli society.

Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal were 22-year-old best friends when they were kidnapped at the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023. The Hamas video showed them sitting in a minivan watching the propaganda-laden handover ceremony, and then turning to the cameras to plead with Benjamin Netanyahu to agree a second phase in the current ceasefire, which would allow the release of all the remaining 59 hostages (only a minority of whom are thought to be still alive).

The majority of Israelis and international public opinion, the Trump administration included, want a second phase but, as conceived in the original truce agreement in January, that would involve elements including a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, which could bring down Netanyahu’s rightwing coalition.

An Israeli delegation at talks in Cairo on Friday is reported to have called for a six-week extension to the first phase of the ceasefire. According to Egyptian media, it would involve further hostage releases in exchange for hundreds more Palestinians held in Israeli jails, but it would postpone military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Hamas is said to have rejected the proposal.

For Ilay David, Evyatar’s older brother, the video was confirmation of an emotional certainty that the family had held on for the 16 months since the outbreak of war: he was alive.

“It was the first ever sign of life,” Ilay said. “We had this feeling that he’s OK and he’s surviving. I had no doubt, but seeing it was amazing. For me, it was like oxygen.”

For his family, the joy of seeing Evyatar alive was marred by his appearance, and the intense suffering it implied.

“He looks half the man he was. He looks starved. He looks exhausted,” Ilay said. He has talked to released hostages who were held with Evyatar for months and heard about the conditions in narrow, airless tunnels, with starvation rations – “a pitta a day and two spoonfuls of cheese”.

On the other hand, it was a comfort to see Evyatar with his childhood friend, Gilboa-Dalal, with whom he had gone to the music festival, and to know he was not completely alone.

Hamas knew very well what it was doing with the video. Seeing these two young men pleading for peace and their release has underlined the human costs Israel will suffer if it goes back to war.

Ilay was already spending most of his time campaigning for the ceasefire but said the video had brought even greater urgency to his family’s mission.

“It only drives us to do more, to speak with more people, to keep lobbying, to make him more visible – as visible as we can make him,” he said.

He recently returned from a lobbying trip to Washington where he met senators, state department officials and, most importantly, Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East who has publicly insisted that the ceasefire continue until all the hostages are free and the bodies of the dead handed over.

“He will try with all of his might to bring back all the hostages, whether it’s second phase or another phase or another kind of deal,” Ilay said. “He’s a warm person, very decent, very honest, and Trump relies on him.”

All of that does not necessarily mean that Netanyahu will follow Witkoff’s guidance, especially if it could break his coalition apart and result in early elections. The Israel Defense Forces are due to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border eight days into the second phase of the ceasefire. It is a strip of land that Netanyahu has previously deemed to be vital to Israeli security, and abandoning it could well cause a coalition crisis.

“The IDF retreat from Philadelphi – that’s a big deal. It’s a big asset to Israel, so I don’t know what will happen,” Ilay said. “We understand that these are critical moments. Decisions are being made right now.”

As for Netanyahu, he said: “I count on him to bring the hostages back and I think he understands that to bring them back is … something which goes to the core of the Jewish nation and the ethos of the Israeli state – solidarity and leaving no one behind.”

As well as visiting the Trump administration, Ilay has been touring the West Bank, visiting militant settlers, the constituency most adamantly opposed to the ceasefire, seeking to engage anyone who will talk to him.

“We are right now in this weird moment where a lot depends on the pressure that the families can put on the government but also on the public,” he said. “We try to do whatever we can to speak to politicians and with public leaders and military veterans – anyone who has any influence.”"
Shortsighted Taiwan may have lessons for the world as a preventable disease skyrockets,['Helen Davidson'],2025-03-01,"In the final days of their eight-week bootcamp, dozens of young Taiwanese conscripts are being tested on an obstacle course. The men in full combat kit are crawling underneath rows of razor wire and through bunkers as controlled explosions blast columns of dirt into the air. Pink and green smoke blooms in a simulated gas attack, requiring the conscripts to quickly don gas masks so they can rush the zone. But it’s here where many of them pause, stopping the assault drill to spend precious seconds removing their glasses so the masks will fit.

The conscripts mostly look to be in their early 20s. Statistics suggest that means anywhere up to 90% of them have some degree of myopia, otherwise known as shortsightedness.

Taiwan has one of the world’s highest rates of myopia, alongside most of east Asia and Singapore. As well as the platoons of soldiers in spectacles, there are plenty of other signs. Optometry shops are everywhere – just around Taipei there are more than 40 outlets of Own Days, a chain which tests customers’ eyesight and makes prescription eyewear on-site within an hour. Laser eye surgeons advertise the latest tech, relatively cheaply, to a virtual production line of patients each day. And if you were to visit the front desk of a hospital in Taiwan, instead of pens chained to the counter, you’d probably find a pair of glasses.

‘Once they onset myopia the progression is very fast’

“Eye health is the most important sensory organ in our body. Every day we wake up and need to use our eyes,” says Dr Wu Pei-chang, a leading Taiwanese researcher of the subject and director of the Myopia Treatment and Prevention Center at Kaohsiung hospital.

Myopia is a preventable disease in which abnormal elongation of the eyeball causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of on its surface. The distortion level is measured in diopters, and high myopia (when the distortion has progressed past -5.00 diopters) can lead to blindness if left untreated. The most crucial time is childhood, while a child’s eyes are still developing. “Once they onset myopia the progression is very fast,” says Wu.

For decades science said myopia was a genetic condition, but from the 1960s and 70s an explosion in rates in east Asian countries – which were concurrently undergoing massive economic and educational expansion – upended that thinking. By the 1990s rates of myopia in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore had risen from about 20% to more than 80%. China, initially delayed by the Cultural Revolution, soon joined them.

Governments studied the phenomenon extensively, but it turned out to be quite simple. Myopia is now known to be linked to excessive “nearwork”, like reading, studying and computer work. And more recent studies have found that increased outdoor time is a crucial protective factor.

That’s why scientists say the rates are so high in east Asia and Singapore, where the cultures heavily emphasise high educational outcomes, with extensive study time favoured by parents over outdoor play.

It’s now a problem that is spreading around the world. A study published in September in the British Journal of Ophthalmology found global rates of myopia tripled between 1990 and 2023. By 2050, almost half the world’s population is projected to have it, with corresponding earlier onset, faster progression and greater severity.

Taiwan’s rates are still high but government and social programs have shown measurable success and experts say it is well past its peak. As rates rise in the west, it may have lessons to share.

Outdoor time v screen time

Wu, himself shortsighted, was a young resident when he started to notice an alarming number of his patients and colleagues also had myopia, with many facing serious complications of the disease’s advanced progression. It became his life’s work. In 2004 a paper found that high myopia was the number one cause of irreversible blindness in Taiwan. Lobbied by Wu, who was now on national advisory boards, the government enacted new policies including twice-yearly testing of school students, and improved treatment options. But the rates were still increasing.

“The eyes are developing rapidly [in childhood],” says Prof Ian Morgan, a leading expert in the field, from Australian National University. “The myopia has until around the age of 18 to 20 before it stabilises. So if a kid becomes myopic at the age of six, they still have about 14 years for it to get worse.”

View image in fullscreen A junior high school in Taipei conducts a twice-yearly check of students’ eyesight. Photograph: Helen Davidson/The Guardian

A few years later, two studies – including one from Australia led by Morgan – offered a lightbulb moment for Taiwan. Both found that the more time kids spent outdoors, the less likely they were to have myopia.

Wu ran his own trials, finding similar results. It led to a 2010 government initiative “Tian-tian 120” (120 every day), calling for all children to spend at least two hours outside a day as a “protective factor”.

“It was actually very simple – [the problem was] that myopia has a protective factor and a risk factor, but we had only been focusing on the risk factor,” says Wu.

The outdoor time reversed myopia’s upward trend, bringing the rate among primary schoolchildren from more than 50% down to 45% within a few years. In Yilan, a 2014 community program achieved about a 50% reduction at the preschool level.

Researchers were emboldened. They had found a way to slow the onset of myopia, allowing children to reach the crucial stage of adulthood with minimal progression of the disease.

But they had to convince parents and schools to ease up on the homework time.

Taiwanese statistics show myopia appears to significantly worsen at the times when students move to new school stages with sudden increases in study load. A 2017 study found the rate of myopia increased from 9% to 19.8% between the ages of six and seven, when children start first grade, while high myopia increased by more than 50% between 6th and 7th grade.

At a junior high school in central Taipei, dozens of 8th grade students are lined up outside the school clinic for their twice-yearly check. If any show signs of myopia, the two staff nurses will send a letter home to the parents within days, with requests to show proof of medical follow-ups within a fortnight.

There are also growing concerns about the impact of screen time, which is rising globally. Last week a Korean study found every hour of screen time raised the chances of myopia among children.

Hong Kong primary students – who spent much of the Covid pandemic doing online learning – more than tripled the averages hours they spent on screens each day, SCMP reported in 2023. In the same period, rates of myopia went up 2.5 times, according to the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In China’s Shandong province, Wu says, the rate among six- and seven-year-olds jumped from about 5% to 25%.

Rates in Taiwan are still high but Morgan and Wu say the peak is over and Taiwan is on the way to bringing rates down. Government data is frustratingly scant, but Wu says he is finalising a 10-year study that is suggesting the prevalence is now “down very low” from a decade ago.

At the Taipei junior high school, the teachers estimate their students get probably 60 minutes of outdoor time during school hours, and maybe another 30 on their way home. But as the kids move up grades, “the pressure to study increases”.

Asked where the pressure is still coming from – the school, parents or peers – the teachers laugh. “Everywhere.”

Timothée Chalamet deserves an Oscar – for his Oscar campaign,['Adrian Horton'],2025-02-28,"On Sunday, Timothée Chalamet could become, at 29 years, two months and three days, the youngest best actor winner in Oscar history. But whether or not his performance as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown beats out presumed frontrunner Adrien Brody – the current youngest best actor, at 29 years, 11 months and nine days in 2003 – Chalamet has already won arguably the most important prize of modern movie stardom: the hearts and minds of the internet.

If we’re in the business of giving out awards for deserving, boundary-pushing work, then Chalamet’s best actor campaign – unofficial and often unspoken efforts to sway awards voters and build public sentiment – deserves its own Oscar. For the past several months, ostensibly in support of A Complete Unknown but seemingly just as much for laughs, Chalamet has embarked on a rare press run of consistent wins that generated viral moments and appealed to the reference-averse, absurdist sensibilities of his generation, bucking the usually staid methods of Hollywood promotion. Whereas past best actor hopefuls have erred on the side of grateful, serious and dutiful to the self-importance of the boomer-skewing Academy, Chalamet has worn kitschy outfits to red carpet events, treated social media like an ironic art experiment and made the rounds with influencers. In other words, though Chalamet is technically a millennial (born in 1995), we are witnessing the first genZ Oscar campaign.

And what a delight it’s been. There is plenty to be cynical about when it comes to awards season – the repetition, the speeches written by consultants, the cloying campaign-ness of it all – but Chalamet out-predicting professional sports analysts on College Gameday (?!) is not one of them. The first sign that Chalamet would be up to something different – that he would be in on the joke – was back in October, two months before the domestic release of A Complete Unknown, when he crashed a crowdsourced lookalike contest in New York’s Washington Square Park, temporarily causing gleeful pandemonium (until the cops showed up). He followed with a series of wacky, weird, surprising public appearances that have deftly threaded a needle of sincere and unserious, from dressing up as Bob Dylan circa 2003’s Sundance, blond bangs and all, to remixing Dylan deep cuts on Saturday Night Live as one of the few musical guests who isn’t a recording artist.

A non-exhaustive list of highlights: riding a Lime bike on to a red carpet (and later telling a French interviewer that he was fined £65 for illegal parking); giving podcast bro Theo Von a lesson on publicly subsidized housing (Chalamet grew up in Mitchell-Lama arts housing in Manhattan); fanboying over Kendrick Lamar in a ride-along “interview” for the Super Bowl; hosting a bizarre Instagram live from an empty warehouse in which he smashed a guitar, writhed with confetti to the 2009 Black Eyed Peas track I Gotta Feeling, and appeared in front of a screen with intentionally misspelled messages like “congratulations timmothee”.

For every conventional, in-the-feels interview stop – a classic Serious Artist Rolling Stone cover, a 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper on honing his ambition, an Apple Music interview with Zane Lowe on inhabiting Dylan’s music – there have been multiple ridiculous, internet-aiming victory laps. See: talking Brat with oddball Canadian music journalist Nardwuar, and an absurd and delightful interview with YouTuber Brittany Broski in which he described his lean aesthetic as “empowering the anemic”. And that’s not even getting into a series of lo-fi Instagram videos in which Chalamet sings along to various songs – the Dylan track Visions of Johanna, a number from the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack – at various outdoor locations in a style I can best describe as “aspirational performing arts school project”.

All of this evinces a fact that many forget: being an actor and being a movie star are not the same thing. Timothée Chalamet is a phenomenally talented actor who, by his own admission, strives to be considered one of the greats. He said the quiet part out loud (unusual) in his Sag acceptance speech a week before the Oscars – his first major award after nearly two dozen nominations by the age of 30: “I’m really in pursuit of greatness,” he said, wearing a lime green shirt, leather suit and bolo tie in tribute to another archival Dylan look. “I know people don’t usually talk like that but I want to be one of the greats.”

But awards campaigns are never just about talent, and Chalamet is, crucially, great at being a celebrity. This entire press run has evinced his concurrent talent for holding attention in the ways he wants to, for not taking oneself too seriously while also maintaining deep reverence for the craft, for balancing the esoteric and the very dumb, with some clear YouTube research. And mostly, to laugh at oneself in a way that also benefits one’s appeal, a through-line from the lookalike contest to showing Cooper a video of his high school rap alter ego, Timmy Tim. Chalamet is the rare extremely famous person who seems to actually enjoy being famous – or, at the very least, is having some harmless fun with it. So here’s to Chalamet’s Oscar campaign, a breath of fresh air in a practice that tends to range from just moderately enjoyable to outright annoying. Especially this year, the Oscars season, and pop culture at large, needed it."
‘I felt like I was his carer’: why straight women in relationships lose interest in sex,['Alyx Gorman'],2025-03-01,"Zoe and her husband, Charles, can’t keep their hands off each other. They were like this in the early stages of their relationship, too – “there was something wrong with us” – Zoe jokes about their prolific lovemaking. But this new, “giddy” phase is different.

“It feels like we’ve just started again. But with all this history, and this amazing child, and all this other stuff that binds us together,” she says.

Less than a year before I spoke with her, those bindings were coming loose. Zoe had a young child and she was working a difficult, high-stress job. To top it off, Charles was not helping. He chafed against the constraints of early fatherhood and parenting brought up difficult feelings about his own childhood that he struggled to understand.

“He started projecting all his insecurities on to our marriage,” Zoe says. He’d complain about how they hardly went out, hardly had sex. “All these things that are just a phase of your life when you have a small child … I was just getting so frustrated, because I felt like I was his carer and the carer of a baby.

In the end, she told him she could not cope any more and that there was no space for her emotional wellbeing. She was just worried about him, or catering to his needs, or catering to the baby’s needs.

She said: “It would just be easier to have me and the baby, to be honest.”

After some time apart, Charles realised he had to make changes. First, he tried to enlist Zoe in his self-improvement efforts. He asked her to write a list of everything she was doing around the house, so he could understand the tasks he had not been helping with. Her list being long enough without the addition of writing another list, Zoe refused.

Charles started seeing a psychologist and soon realised Zoe had been right about the housework too. “It was a long road of therapy, and he did a lot of work trying to understand the mental load … figuring out how to be a grownup, and a dad, and a husband all at the same time,” she says.

Eventually, “we got there. I finally have a teammate, an actual partner who picks up the slack without being asked, and who does things for us without being asked, and who takes control of situations without me having to tell him to.”

“It’s kind of hard not to be horny for someone who’s put in all this work to be a better person,” she says.

To me, Zoe’s story is a 21st-century fairytale. But not every Cinderella who finds herself stuck doing most of the emotional labour – alongside childcare, housework and work outside the home – can convince her handsome prince to pick up his broom and start sweeping.

Zoe is one of 55 women to have told me about her love life in the last two years. Some of those women were newly coupled up, some divorced, some permanently single and some in long-term relationships. And at least a quarter of those women had been in situations like Zoe’s at some point – long term relationships where they felt there was “no space” for their needs or desires. While Zoe’s story is far from the only happy ending these women shared, it is the only one that did not involve a breakup.

It’s kind of hard not to be horny for someone who’s put in all this work Zoe*

Aleks Trkulja, an Australian sex therapist, says it’s not uncommon for female clients to come into her practice with low desire or other sexual function issues that are clearly relational, not individual. Several other therapists have told me similar stories.

Therapists are trained not to be directive, says Dr Lori Brotto, a Canadian clinical and research psychologist who works with women experiencing low desire. While a girlfriend can tell a woman, “He’s a jerk, get rid of him,” Brotto can’t do that, “even when I’m thinking that”.

Rather than telling someone to leave, “it’s about asking the questions in a way that helps the person realise that actually their partner is contributing quite a bit to their low desire”.

The dynamic Zoe was experiencing before Charles stepped up is something Brotto sees frequently in her clinic. It is part of why she contributed to the heteronormativity theory of low sexual desire in women partnered with men.

Published in 2022 by some of the world’s leading researchers on human sexuality, this theory lays out how several gendered expectations placed on women (and men) serve to obliterate women’s sexual flourishing.

Dr Sari van Anders, a Canadian scientist, is the heteronormativity theory’s lead author; her work is in neuroendocrinology, sexuality and gender/sex. Over a video call, she explained to me that while the pressures that create gendered roles are social, they end up having a biological impact too.

For instance, being sexually aroused is a form of stress in that it’s different from how you usually feel. “People don’t walk around sexually aroused all the time, even those of us who might be sexually aroused very often,” van Anders says.

It’s not just our feelings that get burnt out, it’s also hormones and bodies Dr Sari van Anders

But if you’re stressed out, over time your body decreases the amount of stress hormones it releases in response to any given situation – regardless of whether that stress is good (like arousal) or bad (like coming home to a cockroach in the sink because someone didn’t do the washing-up at breakfast).

Women tend to experience much higher levels of chronic stress than men do, van Anders says, which can mean that over time, women’s bodies are just less able to react to things that might once have given them sexual feelings. “It’s not just our feelings that get burnt out, it’s also hormones and bodies.”

This isn’t the only change that takes place in unequal households. While her research is still in its early stages, van Anders is beginning to explore the ways in which certain forms of caregiving – a conflation between the role of sexual partner and mother – might also decrease women’s sexual responses.

“There’s evidence that parenting is associated with … a suppression of sexuality for most people,” van Anders says. This is a good thing – you do not want parents craving sex around their children. While it is hard to test for, there is some evidence to suggest that when women start to view their partners more like another child to care for rather than as an equal, the same suppression of sexuality might happen then, too.

While research into this phenomenon is only just beginning, the circumstances are nothing new. In 1987, when Shere Hite, a sex researcher, surveyed thousands of women, she reported that in 76% of households where women worked full-time or cared for young children, those women felt there was no concrete arrangement for sharing the domestic load. The assumption was that women would do the work and men would, possibly, help.

Hite also wrote that 76% of women felt there was a “maddeningly unfair” disparity between the emotional support they were expected to provide and the emotional support they received in return.

In 2012, economist and author Eve Rodsky also surveyed women around the world for her book Fair Play. She also wanted to understand the division of household labour in heterosexual couples. What she found was “the same shit, different decade”.

As Rodsky puts it, when households are not functioning fairly, accountability and trust break down. “And that was when I would see the lack of intimacy,” Rodsky says. People rarely want to have sex with someone they resent or a person they see as just another chore on a long to-do list.

If you ever expect to spend quality time with a woman in bed, then you have to be the one making it Erik*

The link between household labour and sexual flourishing is something Erik’s mother might have known intuitively when, during his teenage years, she told him: “If you ever expect to spend quality time with a woman in bed, then you have to be the one making it.” As in: doing the laundry, drying the sheets, bringing them in and putting them on the bed.

I spoke with Erik because I put a callout on social media asking women to nominate men they thought were exceptionally good in bed; Erik’s new girlfriend put him forward. While this egalitarian attitude towards housework is far from the only reason Erik impressed his partner, it certainly did not hurt.

While men in Australia spend an average of 3 hours and 12 minutes a day on unpaid labour, women spend 4 hours and 31 minutes. What’s more, men’s efforts tend to be concentrated on higher schedule control, more rewarding activities like car maintenance, home maintenance and gardening, while women take on the lower schedule control, less joyful chores like housework, cooking and shopping.

Good sex takes time, space, physical and emotional energy – something many women, particularly working mothers, are missing from their lives.

Eve Rodsky calls this conscious cultivation of time and distance “unicorn space” – inspired by the Ancient Greek concept of eudaemonic wellbeing. Having unicorn space means having not just the time but the emotional support to pursue your own passions.

In her research, “the more you have a strong sense of self and identity, the more people were reporting sexual intimacy”, Rodsky says.

If the burden of unpaid domestic work was split down the middle, just think what an extra six hours a week could do for straight women’s love lives. One woman wrote to Rodsky saying that after reconfiguring her domestic load, she finally had the time to join a rock band. In her letter, she said: “Sex is so much better when I get offstage in leather pants.”

Want to avoid forever chemicals? Here are nine of the best PFAS-free frying pans,['Linda Geddes'],2025-02-28,"Whether you’re making pancakes, seared steaks or fluffy omelettes, a frying pan that sizzles food without sticking to it is a kitchen necessity. Yet health and environmental concerns about non-stick coatings and “forever chemicals” are making it increasingly complicated to pick the perfect pan.

The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.

Manufacturers of non-stick coatings insist they’re perfectly safe, but a growing number of companies are advertising their products as PFOA- or PFOS-free, all the same. So what are these controversial chemicals, and what’s the alternative if you don’t want your food to stick?

What are forever chemicals, or PFAS?

For the uninitiated, per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of chemicals that have been added to various consumer products, including cookware, since the 1950s. There are thousands of these chemicals, and they’re extremely useful, allowing dirt, grease – and eggs – to slide off surfaces. But once thrown away, it can take hundreds or even thousands of years for PFAS to degrade, which is why they are often referred to as “forever chemicals”. They can also leach out of landfill to contaminate soil and water, and accumulate in the tissues of living things over time. That can “threaten the wellbeing of species already struggling under mounting environmental pressures,” says Hannah Evans, a project manager at the environmental charity Fidra.

A handful of PFAS that have been researched in depth have been linked to health issues such as cancer, immune system disorders and fertility problems. This EPA report is a reputable source and provides a good overview of the knowns and unknowns.

However, most of these chemicals are understudied, meaning their health and environmental impact is unknown. Some may be perfectly safe, including the PTFE- or Teflon-based coatings that are often sprayed on to pans to make them non-stick – although additional PFAS may have been used to manufacture them.

There are questions about their toxicity. For example, tetrafluoroethylene is used to make PTFE and the US National Institutes of Health lists it as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen”. GenX is another chemical used to make Teflon and other types of PTFE. The US Environment Protection Agency has concluded that it may also be carcinogenic, based on animal studies.

Because we can be exposed to PFAS in so many ways, and it is difficult to identify specific “causes and effects” for individual chemicals, many campaigners believe it is better to be safe than sorry – particularly when PFAS-free alternatives exist. Fidra and others are calling for a group-based restriction on all non-essential uses of PFAS in the UK, including frying pans. The good news is that alternative non-stick coatings are available, as are other types of frying pans that have no coatings at all, such as stainless steel or cast iron pans.

Here’s our roundup of the best PFAS-free crepe pans and all-purpose frying pans for Pancake Day and beyond.

The best PFAS-free crepe pans

Best carbon steel crepe pan:

De Buyer Mineral B crepe pan

£58.78 at Nisbets

£58.87 at Amazon

Crafted in France from carbon steel, which heats up quickly and conducts heat well, fans of the De Buyer Mineral B crepe pan say it helps make an authentic French-style crepe with crispy edges. Like cast iron, it can withstand high temperatures, but it’s lighter, making it easier to toss pancakes. It can also be used for cooking dosas, injera and searing vegetables. The pan is oven safe for up to 10 minutes at 200C.

Carbon steel needs regular seasoning with oil, and this pan needs to be pre-seasoned before its first use. It should be cleaned only with a damp cloth and must be thoroughly dried and oiled before storage. Follow these instructions, and you’ll be rewarded with a crepe pan that builds up a dark patina and becomes more non-stick with time. This pan comes with a two-year guarantee.

Best non-stick crepe pan:

GreenPan Copenhagen pancake pan

£54.40 at GreenPan

£68 at John Lewis

This specialist crepe pan is light and shallow and helps create delightfully flippable pancakes that slide off the surface with ease. It features GreenPan’s Thermolon non-stick coating, and it is suitable for all hob types.

GreenPan is verified PFAS-free by Fidra, and the key material in its non-stick cookware is silicon dioxide – which is also found in natural sand. The brand claims its non-stick coating is heat-resistant up to 450C (850F), oven-safe up to 220C (425F) and dishwasher-safe. Even so, it recommends using its pan on a low to medium heat, using a small amount of oil – but not olive oil – or butter rather than cooking sprays, hand-washing with a soft cloth, and avoiding metal utensils to help preserve the coating.

If you’re after a low-maintenance crepe pan, GreenPan’s is a great alternative to a carbon steel one.

Best cast-iron crepe pan:

Le Creuset small cast iron crepe pan

£139 at Le Creuset

£139 at Amazon

While owners of conventional cast iron pans may be wary of cooking pancakes in them, this classic-looking Le Creuset pan has a PFAS-free enamel coating, which users describe as a gamechanger – provided it is heated up slowly and a smear of oil or butter added before the batter. The pan is a little heavy for tossing but pancakes can be easily flipped using the wooden spatula provided. It can also be used for frying french toast, chapatis, naan bread, or grilling meat and vegetables (the pan is grill- and oven-safe).

Provided the pan is used in normal, domestic conditions and the care and use instructions are followed, Le Creuset offers a lifetime guarantee covering faulty workmanship and materials.

The best all-purpose PFAS-free frying pans

Best non-stick frying pan:

GreenPan Barcelona Pro

£76 at GreenPan

£76 at Harts of Stur

With its deep, sloped sides, and elegant styling, this frying pan is perfect for cooking eggs, fish and vegetables with minimal oil, or simmering sauces such as bolognese, although it is a little too deep for pancakes. It features the same non-stick coating as GreenPan’s Copenhagen pancake pan and if used following the instructions, is covered by a two-year warranty for manufacturing and material defects.

Best small non-stick frying pan:

Earth Pan ceramic non-stick frying pan

£43 at Prestige

£43 at Tesco

The Earth Pan range is made without PFAS and uses a lead- and cadmium-free non-stick coating. Its handle – made from recycled plastics – is designed to stay cool to the touch throughout cooking. It also comes with a five-year guarantee, provided it’s used following the manufacturer’s instructions.

This 20cm frying pan has gently sloping sides, making it ideal for cooking omelettes and other small to medium-sized meals. However, it’s not oven-safe, so it’s not as versatile as some other non-stick pans.

Most versatile non-stick pan:

Our Place Always Pan 2.0

From £100 at Our Place

From £100 at Amazon

If you have limited kitchen space and need a non-stick frying pan with multiple functions, Our Place’s Always Pan is worthy of consideration. Supporting up to 10 cooking methods – including roasting and steaming – one of the few things this pan is poorly equipped to handle is pancakes, due to its deep sides.

Our Place claims its pan’s ceramic coating is heat- and oven-resistant up to 230C (446F), which should make it fine for low to medium heats. Some users have complained that the coating can become less slippery with time, though, so it’s worth paying close attention to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Best budget non-stick pan:

MasterClass ceramic coated frying pan

£19.96 at Harts of Stur

£21.99 at Amazon

For chefs who prefer a light and shallow non-stick pan, the MasterClass ceramic induction-ready pan is a good choice, although some caution that the coating gradually becomes less non-stick if used on high heat settings. So, as with other PFAS-free non-stick pans, it’s worth reading the manufacturer’s instructions and accepting that this pan may need replacing after a few years – although it is guaranteed for 15 years.

This frying pan weighs 750g, is equipped with a ceramic handle to avoid it getting hot, and has gently sloping sides, making it good for pancake tossing.

Best stainless-steel frying pan:

ProCook Elite tri-ply frying pan

£69 at ProCook

Professional chefs often opt for stainless-steel cookware, due to its durability, resistance to scratches and corrosion, good heat conductivity, and ability to handle high temperatures. These pans are excellent for most cooking, from searing meat to frying. There’s no non-stick coating to wear off, so such pans should have a long lifespan – ProCook’s Elite tri-ply pan comes with a 25-year guarantee. Its construction comprises a stainless-steel exterior, aluminium core and stainless-steel interior, which ensures even cooking without hotspots. It’s also oven-safe to 260C and dishwasher-safe, although cleaning is best done in hot soapy water with a non-wire scouring pad.

The lack of non-stick coating means chefs should add a glug of oil or smear of butter to the pan before cooking to prevent food from sticking. To cook pancakes in a stainless-steel pan, ProCook’s food expert Steven Carter-Bailey recommends preheating it over low to medium heat and testing if it’s ready by sprinkling a few drops of water on to the surface: “If they dance and sizzle, you’re good to go.” You should then add a thin layer of oil, butter or ghee before pouring in the batter. Between batches, lightly reapply oil and adjust the heat, if necessary, to prevent burning.

Best cast iron frying pan:

Solidteknics iron skillet

£110 at Solidteknics

Cast iron pans are renowned for their durability, excellent heat retention and ability to withstand high temperatures, which means you can use them to sear steaks, cook or fry things slowly, create oven-baked dishes, or even cook over an open fire. However, they’re heavy and require regular seasoning to prevent rust.

Wrought from a single sheet of iron, Solidteknics’ pan is half the weight of a conventional cast iron pan and comes pre-seasoned with rice bran oil, although it might be worth doing an additional season yourself to improve the pan’s non-stick qualities.

The secret to preventing sticking in an iron pan is to preheat it for several minutes on a low to medium heat (if the pan gets too hot, this can also cause food to stick to its surface and burn) and add oil or butter before any food.

With no coatings or joins to wear out or fail, this pan comes with a “multi-century warranty” for all defects related to materials or manufacturing that occur during normal cooking. The company suggests cleaning it only with hot water and a soft sponge, never placing it in a dishwasher, thoroughly drying it before storage, and regularly seasoning it with a thin layer of cooking oil.

What you need to know

How do you identify a PFAS-free pan?

For now, it is up to consumers to decide whether to buy a conventional non-stick pan or a PFAS-free alternative. However, choosing the latter isn’t as straightforward as it may seem. Many pans are labelled “PFOA-free” or “PFOS-free”, referencing two PFAS with proven health concerns, but these chemicals are already banned under a global treaty called the Stockholm Convention. “Neither do these labels necessarily mean the pan is free from all PFAS, only those specific named PFAS,” says Eleanor Hawke, a campaigner for the environmental charity Chem Trust.

Many highly rated non-stick pans that made it on to our longlist were rejected after closer inspection revealed that they contained PTFE or Teflon. This was also true of some “ceramic” coated pans, which also contained PTFE. Teflon and other types of PTFE are considered inert below about 260C, but there are concerns that they may release harmful chemicals when heated to high temperatures. And as mentioned above, the PFAS chemicals used to manufacture these substances can get into rivers and drinking water, accumulating in the plants and animals we eat, and so on. There are also worries about what happens to PTFE when it is thrown away and begins to degrade over the coming centuries. For these reasons, I have avoided reviewing pans coated with PTFE or Teflon.

“To know whether the pan is PFAS-free, we would recommend consumers ask the retailer,” Hawke says. However, because manufacturers are not required to disclose if PFAS is contained in their products, retailers may not know. Evans of Fidra recommends checking product labels for mention of PFAS, as well as PFOA or PFOS, but a PFOA/PFOS label is largely meaningless: a PFAS-free label is more helpful as this covers PTFE.

What are the alternatives?

A growing number of companies are applying PFAS-free non-stick coatings to their cookware. Fidra lists some of these on its website, including some non-UK-based companies, but this is “by no means an exhaustive list”, Evans says.

An alternative is to avoid non-stick coatings altogether, especially as these will eventually wear off, and opt for a stainless steel, iron or carbon steel pan instead. The latter two require a little more upkeep, including regular “seasoning”, which involves rubbing a small amount of cooking oil into their surface. And these pans require more oil or butter to be added before cooking to prevent food from sticking. But if they’re well cared for, they can last a lifetime.

Linda Geddes is a former Guardian science correspondent"
‘I spent 12 hours a day for 16 months with Gene Hackman – but never met him’: The Conversation’s Walter Murch pays tribute,[],2025-02-28,"I never formally met Gene Hackman. I glimpsed him once, in November 1972, when he bounded upstairs to the offices of American Zoetrope in San Francisco, but I didn’t recognise him until he told the receptionist that he was here to see Mona Skager.

Francis Ford Coppola’s film The Conversation was about to start shooting in two weeks, and Mona was Francis’s associate producer. I was to be the film’s editor. That brief and solitary glimpse of Gene in real life was counterbalanced by 16 months of daily screen contact with Harry Caul, the character brought to life by Hackman.

This was my first job as editor of a feature film, and I was in alternating states of excitement and terror. Previously, I had edited some commercials, a couple of short documentaries and one educational film. I had also done the sound design for The Rain People and The Godfather, Coppola’s two previous feature films, as well as the sound design for George Lucas’s feature THX 1138.

But editing The Conversation was a big turn up the spiral for me, which explained the excitement. The terror was induced by the fact that this was the next film by the director who had just transfixed the world with The Godfather. If The Conversation failed, for whatever reason, much of the blame would fall on the shoulders of this young and inexperienced editor.

The relationship between actors and film editors is a classic case of asymmetry: editors stare at actors 10 to 12 hours a day, sometimes more, and we microscopically study their every move, flinch, blink, gesture and inflection. We become actor-anthropologists, students of this strange tribe, and we inhale their rhythms which become second nature to us, and then translate them into the editing style and pacing of the film.

In a certain sense, we know this narrow spectrum of an actor better than anyone – perhaps in some cases better than the actors themselves. If we later meet them in person, this asymmetry really makes itself felt; they frequently have no idea who we are, other than appendages of the director, but we have all that secret and microscopic knowledge: how they prefer to turn left rather than right, their characteristic way of hesitating before opening a door, how often they blink …

The integrity of Hackman’s performance provided the metronomic spine which supported and guided me

There were many times, often at 3am in the morning, when Harry would push a button on his tape recorder, stopping it, and so closely did I identify with him that I would be amazed to find my KEM editing machine still running, having not obeyed Harry’s command.

During one session, another all-nighter, I finally noticed that very close to where I would decide to make a cut, Harry would blink. Was I controlling Harry, or was he controlling me? This confusion was ultimately resolved: the cut is a blink, and this realisation, triggered by Gene’s performance, became one of the foundational ideas of my book on film editing, In the Blink of an Eye, first published in 1992.

So in a very real sense, the integrity of Hackman’s performance provided the metronomic spine which supported and guided me, often without my knowing it, to find the correct pacing for each scene, and then the right structure of the collection of those scenes in the finished film. I shudder to think what would have happened if Harry had been performed by someone else.

So I was hit hard by the news of Gene’s death for all kinds of reasons – I am a huge fan of his work across five decades of American cinema – but particularly because of the guidance and inspiration he gave me implicitly during the editing of The Conversation. I never had the opportunity to thank him personally for helping me to become the film-maker that I am today. So I do that now: ‘Thank you, Gene.’

‘I am willing to die’: hunger-striking mother of writer jailed in Egypt fights on in London hospital bed,['Patrick Wintour'],2025-02-28,"Laila Soueif, lying in a hospital bed after refusing all food for 152 days in a bid to free her jailed son, agreed on Wednesday night to be put on a glucose drip, though it is only likely to delay her full collapse by days.

She told the Guardian she had taken the step as part of a deal she had reached with her children that they would be allowed one chance to intervene before she collapses.

It is likely she will last the next few days, but thereafter she is back to the unknown, and has only been surviving with such low sugar levels because her decline has been a slow process, allowing her body to adapt.

She has been on hunger strike to free her British-Egyptian son, Alaa Abd el-Fattah, from a Cairo jail.

Her son, a writer and activist, has been arrested numerous times and last September he completed his five-year sentence, if his two years in detention before sentencing are taken into account, as is specified by Egyptian law.

She was admitted to St Thomas’ hospital in central London on Monday due to dangerously low blood sugar levels.

A note released by her doctor said there was a high risk of sudden death.

She insists: “I am willing to die and no, I am not personally scared. I am worried about my girls. It is like I feel apologetic to them. But I think by now I am just as effective dead as alive. I think the campaign for his release will go on if I die. It is strong enough that it will continue after I have gone, and so I will have not died in vain.”

Her son knows she is in hospital, but has not been able to communicate with her.

She has lost a third of her weight, her blood sugar reading has dropped and her face in the past fortnight has become noticeably thinner, the lines on her face even deeper than before. Flowers from the Foreign Office and a book on the Palestinians lie by her bedside, which ironically overlooks the House of Commons.

At her bedside are her two daughters, Mona and Sanaa, and other family and friends, many of them Egyptian intellectuals. She insists that once this glucose has been taken, there will be no other infusion until she is unconscious. The doctors, caught in a moral dilemma, have agreed to respect her wishes, including her continued refusal to eat food.

The drip was only agreed after her doctor gave her the stern warning that her organs, in particular her heart and brain, are likely to become permanently damaged. They wrote: “We advise intravenous glucose or controlled refeeding immediately to reduce the risk to herself. The longer the duration of her fasting, the higher the risk of death during the refeeding process, should she cease fasting.”

She said: “I will continue until there is some positive response from the Egyptian government, whether it is allowing my son to have a consular visit or his release.”

There is a faint hope that with the Egyptian state traditionally willing to grant pardons at Ramadan, a new push by the British government might lead to a breakthrough.

But the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, by Thursday had not made a phone call to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, to seek his release. He wrote two letters at the turn of the year. On 14 February he met the family to explain what the government had been doing to secure her son’s release. The family in turn brought a copy of his collection of essays, You Have Not Been Defeated.

At prime minister’s questions this week, before travelling to Washington, Starmer promised he would make the call if necessary, and said there was a feeling in the family: “If not now, when?”

The family feel Sisi is immunised by his advisers from bad news, and it may take an external figure such as Starmer to tell him leniency would be in Egypt’s national interest. But such are the secret wheels of diplomacy, and the bigger Middle East issues at stake, that it may be that Sisi has been refusing to take a call from Starmer.

The family have also had numerous meetings with the Foreign Office, but fear the lack of an all-government effort focused on Sisi rather than the Egyptian foreign ministry has made the lobbying ineffective.

Sanaa Soueif said: “When we met Keir Starmer he asked us for more time and promised that he would do all he could to free my brother and reunite him with his son in Brighton. My sister and I have convinced my mother to take one dose of glucose drip, to try to stop her from dying of hunger today.

“Nothing is guaranteed, but we hope that this gives us a few more days with our mother, and that Keir Starmer keeps his promise.”"
‘A huge chunk of men don’t want a funny partner’: the podcast revealing the horrors of dating as a comedian,['Rachel Aroesti'],2025-02-28,"A few months ago, comedians Amy Gledhill and Harriet Kemsley went speed dating. Tentatively hopeful and giddily anxious, they settled their nerves with a drink before arriving at the venue, a trendy south-east London pizzeria. In the event, any excitement was unwarranted: Kemsley “dissociated” and went quiet, while Gledhill found herself in “corporate team-building mode”, using humour to grease the wheels of other people’s dates while disengaging on a personal level. The men weren’t perfect, either: one avoided all eye contact; another recognised Gledhill – who has become a familiar face since winning last year’s Edinburgh fringe prize – and started doing her own material at her. There was a promising development, though: one attender slid into Gledhill’s DMs later that evening – and she replied.

How do I know all this? Because since October, Kemsley and Gledhill have been routinely spilling the beans about their love lives on their candid and hugely endearing podcast Single Ladies in Your Area. The show sees the 37-year-olds grapple with modern dating, a premise that requires them to share their hopes, fears and deepest vulnerabilities. “We divulge too much,” says Kemsley, sitting in the offices of the podcast’s production company, fresh from another heart-on-sleeve recording. “And then we listen to it and go: ‘That’s fine, put it out!’” laughs Gledhill beside her.

The pair came up with the concept at a comedy industry event: they had coincidentally both decided to reveal they were newly single during their respective standup sets. The audience was made up of peers and friends, many of whom didn’t yet know Gledhill had separated from her partner, nor that Kemsley had split from her husband and the father of her daughter, Canadian comic Bobby Mair. When the latter mentioned it, “there was a gasp. It’s horrible when you’re doing live comedy and people are whispering: is this true?! I felt really embarrassed.” Backstage, the pair joked that they should do a podcast on the subject – a joke that quickly morphed into a solid plan.

The charm of Single Ladies in Your Area is rooted in Kemsley and Gledhill’s personalities: unjaded yet meticulously self-effacing; it’s impossible not to become overly invested in the ridiculously likable duo’s romantic (mis)fortunes. From the start, they knew their USP would be relatability – the opposite of “confident, empowered” influencers and their TikTok dating hacks. A recurring theme is their struggle to master the apps: on a recently recorded episode, comedian Stephen Bailey ripped their profiles “to shreds”, says Gledhill. “One of my pictures was actually in a graveyard, and he was like: ‘Get rid of that.’” Kemsley “had put that I like sloths in mine. He said: ‘That’s not how you’re going to meet your person.’” Sharing the content of their profiles on the show has been “so humiliating”, she continues. “You’re selling yourself and it’s such a weird, unnatural thing to do.”

The dating landscape may be new to them, but Gledhill and Kemsley are seasoned pros when it comes to mining laughs from love. Gledhill’s latest show, Make Me Look Fit on the Poster, revisits the gobsmacking low points of various past relationships, while Kemsley’s current tour – Everything Always Works Out for Me – focuses on the aftermath of her divorce. It comes after a long period spent collaborating with Mair: in 2017, the couple made a “reality sitcom” about their nuptials for Vice; the following year they appeared on Roast Battle, throwing eye-watering insults at each other in the name of comedy (sample Kemsley line: “Some people say men marry their mother, but I don’t think that’s true because I’m not a dead prostitute”). She describes their work/life crossover as “volatile, but we know each other’s voices so well and you trust each other in those situations”. That said, “I think maybe I wouldn’t do a roast battle with my next husband.”

Gledhill and Kemsley’s shared choice of career has also complicated their romantic prospects. For men, comedy is a surefire way to get girls; for women, it’s “the opposite”, says Gledhill. “There’s a huge chunk of men that don’t want a funny, outspoken partner.” Standup usually revolves round a performer riffing on their failures and flaws, something Gledhill thinks is very appealing to women because they “love a project. Women love to fix men. Whereas men go: ‘Oh, fuck that.’” “Yeah, but we’re not doing that any more!” interjects Kemsley. “We’re learning from the podcast that we don’t want to be fixer-uppers,” Gledhill confirms.

Some men like to be close to female comedians in an unhealthy, creepy way

Bar a few exceptions, the podcast’s guests tend to be the pair’s female comedian pals (Sophie Willan, Chloe Petts, Felicity Ward). It’s reflective of the new standup sisterhood: previously, the unofficial one-woman-per-show rule meant female comics rarely crossed paths, says Kemsley, but the gradual diversification of lineups over the past decade has given them the chance to bond. Nowadays, the scene is “so supportive”, says Gledhill. “There’s some really good friendship groups of just funny, funny women. And we have a fucking great time.”

Solidarity is important in an industry that normalises a lack of personal safety. Some men “really like to be close to female comedians in an unhealthy creepy way”, says Gledhill. There are practical issues, too. In order to afford to attend the Edinburgh fringe one year, Gledhill slept in a cupboard in a flat occupied by 20 strangers. “I didn’t feel scared because I was young. I’d be fucking terrified now.”

While it has always been difficult to make ends meet when performing in Edinburgh – Gledhill once trained as a masseuse and gave massages to festivalgoers so she could pay her bills – rocketing prices have made it harder than ever. “It feels so unfair because you have to spend about £10,000. If it carries on like this, it’ll just be privileged kids. And working-class kids are funny!”

On a personal level, Gledhill no longer has such concerns – in fact, she’s the reigning queen of the fringe. Despite having already been nominated twice as half of comedy double act the Delightful Sausage, she was utterly flabbergasted at being awarded the main comedy prize last year. “When Richard Osman gives me the award I’m in such shock that I’m grimacing,” she says, hauntedly recalling the footage of the ceremony. “I look like I’ve just seen a horrific car accident.”

Kemsley has had some characteristically chaotic Edinburgh experiences; her first fringe involved “accidentally doing a Christian message play. I found out because everyone joined hands and started praying backstage”. At that point the Kent native was attempting to become a “serious” actor “but people kept laughing”. Then her parents advised her to try standup: “They were like mad things always happen to you and you always have funny stories.” She took to it immediately. “I’d always been a bit shy, but doing standup I could say what I thought and people liked it.” Well, not always. The first out-there anecdote she deployed was about “the time I accidentally killed an owl, which sometimes would be too dark”.

Gledhill’s career was sparked by her university boyfriend. “He was an open-mic comedian and he was terrible. And I’d watch him and go: ‘God, I could definitely do it at least as well as him.’” Both Gledhill – who had been a “creepy” classic sitcom obsessive as a child growing up in Hull – and Kemsley say they had never considered a career in standup as youngsters, partly due to the dearth of female comics in the 90s and 00s. “I rarely saw women doing it when I was growing up,” says Gledhill. “Only Jo Brand and maybe Jenny Eclair.”

Times have changed, though. Nowadays, comedy is a more conceivable – and aspirational – career for women. A case in point is that the wall behind the sofa is adorned with huge, glossy posters promoting the pair’s tour shows: Gledhill’s diva-like get-up – voluminous perm and feather-trimmed top – is undercut by Wotsit dust-caked lips; Kemsley, meanwhile, is glam as can be in pink satin, save for the small fire working its way up her long, blond tresses.

Despite their chronic self-deprecation and the apparently repellent nature of their profession, the posters have me wondering whether these two attractive, successful women will be on the market long enough to make the podcast a viable long-term prospect. “People were concerned about that, but it turns out we’re not in any trouble,” deadpans Kemsley.

If they do, the show has already proven to be a strangely valuable communication tool. When a recent squeeze of Gledhill started listening, the effect was “kind of cool, because you’re giving someone an instruction manual on how you need to be loved; he knew my love of languages, that I have no boundaries, he knew everything!”

The only problem was that it wasn’t “a two-way street. So I said to him: you need to do me a podcast!” If exchanging personalised audio content turns out to be the next dating innovation, you heard it here first."
"Is this the most terrifying TV show of our times? Adolescence, the drama that will horrify all parents",['Stuart Heritage'],2025-02-28,"The first few minutes of Netflix’s new drama Adolescence are among the most incredible you will ever see. Two police officers drive to a house, smash its doors in, sweep from room to room and apprehend a teenage boy suspected of murdering a female classmate. They load him into a van, drive to a police station then process him for arrest.

On the surface this sounds like any workaday drama, but the incredible thing about Adolescence is this: the whole sequence is conducted in one take. From car to house to van to station, the camera never leaves the action. Even more incredibly, the entire series follows in kind. There are four episodes, each without a single edit.

Adolescence is very much the baby of Stephen Graham, who not only stars as the boy’s father, but also co-created and co-wrote the series. “There had been a lot of cases of stabbings across the country,” explains Graham. “Some were incidents with young boys who were stabbing young girls.” These incidents started to meld with his love of the documentary series 24 Hours in Police Custody and his previous work in the one-shot film Boiling Point, and Adolescence began to take root.

But it was ambitious, and required a dream team. To build it out, Graham pulled from talent he’d worked with before. He cast his childhood friend Christine Tremarco to play his wife and, from his new Disney+ series A Thousand Blows, Erin Doherty and Ashley Walters.

“Steve was like: ‘You might think you’ve played this type of part before, but you will never have done anything like this,” says Walters, who stars as the lead detective. As much as he was excited by the challenges of the shoot, getting to work more with Graham was the real draw.

“He’s just a nice person,” says Walters. “He’s dedicated to helping others. I don’t think there’s a person in the industry that he doesn’t know, and I don’t think there’s a person in the industry who doesn’t like him. This might be breaking the fourth wall, but most people are not spoken about like that.”

Graham extended the same family attitude to the other creatives. The only choice to direct this was Boiling Point’s Philip Barantini. And as a writing partner, Graham chose his frequent collaborator Jack Thorne.

“We’ve developed this wonderful little marriage, me and Jack,” grins Graham of the prolific playwright. “We are like a combined Frankenstein. I bring him body parts – a torso, a head, some legs, a few hands – and he miraculously injects a spirit.”

“Steve’s starting point was not wanting to blame the parents,” says Thorne of his collaboration. “It was: ‘Let’s not make this about a kid who commits a crime because of an evil thing going on at home.’”

“I didn’t want his dad to be a violent man,” confirms Graham. “I didn’t want Mum to be a drinker. I didn’t want our young boy to be molested by his uncle Tony. I wanted to remove all of those possibilities for us to go: ‘Oh, that’s why he did it.’”

As a result, Adolescence takes us somewhere even more terrifying. Jamie, the show’s 13-year-old subject, is an outwardly normal, well-adjusted kid. But the conversations around him, at school and online, start to lean towards incels and the manosphere. Slowly, a picture builds about how this regular kid found himself radicalised without anyone even realising.

“Stephen and I talked a lot about the last few years in that family, and the moment Jamie just disappeared,” says Thorne. “It just happens. He’s gone. He’s locked behind the door, and he’s in another world, and the parents think it’s fine.”

“I also wanted it to be about how it’s affected everybody else around him,” says Graham. This was a smart, if grim, choice. Seeing a family uneasily try to put themselves back together after a moment of such unimaginable violence is nothing short of harrowing. If you have children of a certain age, on the precipice of getting their own phones, this will be particularly hard to watch.

Still, as heavy as Adolescence is, it also stretches the capacity of what can be achieved with a single take. One sequence in the second episode, which I won’t spoil, is so technically audacious it made me gasp. Barantini confesses that the logistics kept him awake at night. Where Boiling Point only required Barantini and a cinematographer, the scale of Adolescence meant that the camera had to be continually passed from operator to operator, getting clipped in and out of different devices by various teams as necessary.

He takes me through the show’s opening sequence. “When the episode starts, my cinematographer Matt is holding the camera,” he explains. “As we’re filming the actors in the car, the camera’s being attached to a crane. The car drives off, and the crane follows. While this is happening, Matt has gone in another car, driven ahead and jumped out so he can take the camera into the house. When we come back out of the house, the other camera operator Lee is sat in the custody van. Matt would pass Lee the camera, so now Lee’s got the camera while Matt drives ahead to the police station, so he’s ready to take the camera when we go inside.”

Such visual flashiness might suggest that Adolescence is purely a technical experiment, but that couldn’t be further from the case. “I never want the one-take thing to be at the forefront,” says Barantini. “I wanted this to be seamless, but not a spectacle.”

To demonstrate this, the centrepiece of the series is the third episode. There’s no elaborate camerawork; the whole thing is largely confined to a single room. The only characters are the young suspect and Erin Doherty’s child psychologist – and it is absolutely bruising. “I said to Jack: ‘I just want you to write me your version of a David Mamet play,’” says Graham. “And he went: ‘Have you got any more notes?’ I went: ‘No, that’s it.’”

The result is remarkable, not only for how unbearably stressful it is, but in the way that it comprehensively introduces 15-year-old Owen Cooper – a young man with no previous acting credits – as a force to be reckoned with. His performance might qualify as the highlight of the whole enterprise. To watch him is to see a top-tier talent emerge in real time.

“This guy is hands down one of the best actors I’ve ever worked with,” marvels Doherty, grinning at Cooper. “Seriously, it blows my mind that this is your first job. It’s absolutely ridiculous.”

“Erin was the first actor I’d ever worked with,” admits Cooper, who was hired after casting director Shaheen Baig looked at more than 500 boys for the part. I ask how he found his first audition. “I’d never had a job before, so I just sent a tape across, not expecting that much,” says Cooper, completely unfazed. “I got back from school and my mum told me I got the part.”

Was Barantini nervous about handing something so meaty to a first-timer? Not at all, he says. “There’d be moments where Owen really had to be quite evil and nasty to Erin’s character,” he says. “In rehearsals, he was quite scared to go there, because he’d never been that angry before in real life. There was one moment where he had, maybe not a panic attack, but he got quite emotional, and he couldn’t get out of it. I took him outside, and we just sat on a wall and chatted. And I was like: ‘You’re smashing it, you’re incredible. But now that you’ve felt that emotion, you know what it feels like and how to bring yourself out of it.’ It felt like a real turning point.”

With Adolescence now under his belt, Cooper’s career is starting to enter orbit. As well as one project he’s sworn to secrecy over (but will inevitably be enormous upon release) he has also filmed a new comedy with Aimee Lou Wood. “That was the first job I had where it wasn’t a one-shot,” he shrugs. “So I had to get used to that.”

But despite all this – the camera wizardry and the sheer heft of the performances – it’s the themes of Adolescence that will stay with you. “I hope we don’t make the question of male rage an easy question,” says Thorne, before becoming emphatic. “And I certainly hope the conversation around the show doesn’t become about Andrew Tate.” The name of the self-styled “misogynist influencer” comes up a few times during Adolescence, but Thorne is keen to make an important distinction. “Jamie never talks about Andrew Tate once. When he’s mentioned, it’s only by adult characters who are trying to understand him.”

After interrogating such a dark subject, I wonder if Thorne has located the secret of male rage. “I don’t think anyone would be interested if I did,” he says. “And it would be a bad drama if I did. I hope we pose the question well enough that there is conversation on sofas, and that parents have the chance to talk about this stuff with their children.” This seems inevitable. Adolescence is set to be a cultural touchpoint for young masculinity for years to come. What an astonishing thing these people have made.

My partner’s unresolved grief is putting a strain on our relationship,['Annalisa Barbieri'],2025-02-28,"As a teenager, my partner lost their father to illness. He was their idol, so of course this led to profound grief, which I feel is unresolved.

We recently watched a movie that was hauntingly emotional, and my partner was angry afterwards. This led to an argument, with them saying they never want to watch something that will make them feel sadness again. I encouraged them to sit with sadness; they went to bed.

We have been together for six years, and it feels as if they are wanting to shut themselves off from vulnerable emotions. It has been this way since we got together, and I am trying to support them as well as support my own emotional wellbeing.

I believe it is important to remind ourselves of the tragedy and beauty in the world, and not close ourselves off from sadness; I see it as valuable. My partner believes they have experienced too much pain and they want to keep that door closed.

A decade has passed since their father died, and I fully support my partner and understand they must be feeling emotional pain. But I worry that without finding some peace and the ability to take on difficult emotions, it will affect their, and our, future.

I don’t know how to tread. It feels as if I have to sacrifice my own interests and emotional availability to preserve their needs a lot of the time. I want to support them, but I don’t know what to do.

It’s a very common response to turn away from “negative” or hard-to-handle emotions. But what I learned early on in this job is that humans are not like fuse boxes – you can’t isolate one switch: if you numb one emotion, you dampen all of them. Also to even begin to process things we really need to face them.

I went to psychotherapist John-Paul Davies, not least because he taught me that “human beings aren’t built for happiness, they’re built for survival – happiness has to be worked at”. Indeed, if we only pursued happiness, we’d be dead as a species. But in order to experience happiness, we also need to be able to experience sadness.

“One of the repeating themes I see as a therapist,” he said after reading your letter, “is people disconnecting from their sadness and grief and, in turn, one of nature’s greatest gifts to help us move through these emotions: tears.”

Sadness and grief are in the same emotional room as love, and turning against them hinders our capacity for emotional intimacy

Although you haven’t commented on whether your partner is afraid to cry, a lot of people are, even though tears can have soothing properties. While I understand your partner’s fears and their desire not to experience more sadness, Davies explained that “by keeping the door closed in this way, their pain can’t move, it stays frozen in time and is experienced, in one way or another, for ever. A person is then often left only with fear and anger [because the pain is omnipresent] or experiencing nothing much at all emotionally. This is because sadness and grief are in the same emotional room as love, and turning against them hinders our capacity for emotional intimacy and vulnerability, and therefore to really love and be loved.”

Davies wondered if your partner was only like this with others, or if they allow themselves to feel sadness on their own? Some people find it very hard to show such a vulnerable emotion in the company of others.

How to move forward? “It’s important to remember,” said Davies, “that these are often deep-rooted patterns and change can therefore take time. When we learn to live with something early on, it can take time to unlearn living with it, and time to develop and establish a different way of doing things.” I would add that your partner probably sees their way of doing things as protective and having “worked for them so far”, even if it actually doesn’t work for them in the long term or isn’t healthy.

Some people have built up such strong defences against difficult emotions that to change can be too much for them. So I would tread carefully and go slowly. A place to start might be to talk about their dad in a very ordinary, neutral, everyday fashion to see what comes up. Is there anyone else in their family that can help with this process? Your partner may also feel under attack and that processing their grief is letting go of their father. Grief counselling can help.

You and your partner may find this podcast I did on adults bereaved in childhood useful.

A humiliation at the White House and what does it tell us? Trump would make a colony of my country | Andrey Kurkov,['Andrey Kurkov'],2025-02-28,"It’s warming up in Kyiv. The temperature has risen from -5C to 4C. Sometimes, the sun peeps through breaks in the clouds, but Kyivites are not much cheered by the sunshine. They are not watching for signs of spring as they usually do at this time of year. The atmosphere in the city and in the country as a whole has been one of nervous expectation. This was not an expectation of an end to military action or the signing of a peace treaty with Russia – nothing so specific. Indeed, it was not at all clear what we were waiting for, but it was something connected with Donald Trump and the change in US policy towards Ukraine.

Clarity emerged at today’s macabre theatre at the White House: handshakes, a thumbs up and some fist pumps from the US president, before Trump sat side by side with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss a minerals-for-war-support deal and to humiliate him. At the same time, air raid sirens were sounding in northern and eastern Ukraine. Soon the talks were off and Zelenskyy was gone.

What proceeded, in front of TV cameras, was chilling, extraordinary. Zelenskyy grave, angry, desperate – as befits a leader being obliged to bargain away his nation’s birthright. Trump claiming to be the honest broker, saying: “I am not aligned with anybody. I am aligned with the world.” Be thankful, he tells a man who has seen his people murdered, his territory captured and besieged. “Make a deal or we’re out.”

8:25 In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – video

It got worse. Zelenskyy showed him photos of war atrocities. “I think President Trump is on our side,” he said, with no genuine hope and certainly no expectation that that was true. The vice-president, JD Vance, attacked Zelenskyy for being disrespectful. Both Trump and Vance verbally pummelled him for the cameras, for this is the art of the deal now: loaded, hectoring, callous, bloodless.

But then Ukrainians’ belief in a concrete proposal from Trump to end the war had already been replaced by the conviction that the president had no such plan, but rather, many different ideas about US involvement in the region – ideas that often relate to Ukraine, but sometimes conflict with each other and are never focused on supporting a country that is a victim of Russian aggression.

During the past two weeks, we have watched as the issue of ending the Russian-Ukrainian war has transformed into the issue of rare earth metal mining in our country. As it turned out, in Saudi Arabia the participants in the Russian-US negotiations also discussed the extraction of rare earth metals, only they focused on resources in Russian territories and in the occupied territories of Ukraine. These rare earth metals have pushed the topic of the war and military aid to Ukraine out of the media space. That space is filled with dollars now.

Older Ukrainians, who grew up in the Soviet Union, have recognised in this situation the US that was depicted by Soviet propaganda cartoons as a nation of greedy, irresponsible, grab-what-you-can capitalists, who spat on complex problems and had eyes only for dollar superprofits.

This is an existential war, and a new reality. Trump says Zelenskyy is “not ready for peace”, but Ukraine has no choice but to fight on, whatever the cost. Aid that was previously given for nothing must now be bought. If there is no money, then it is necessary to pay with resources. After three years of full-scale Russian aggression, US geopolitical interests in Ukraine have been replaced by financial interests. Instead of the politician President Biden, the businessman President Trump has entered the arena.

Note that the US proposal on the extraction of rare earth metals in Ukraine, if realised, would allow the US side to sign a similar agreement with Russia and start digging without waiting for the end of hostilities. The notion is an “investment fund”, managed by the US and Ukraine on “equal terms”, into which Ukraine would contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas “to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine”. Trump insists it is “very fair”.

Would such an agreement encourage Russia to cease its aggression? No! Does it contain security guarantees for Ukraine? It seems not. Does Ukraine have any choice? Debatable.

In this situation, Britain and the EU become much more important partners for Ukraine than before. While organising favourable access to Ukrainian resources for the US, Trump hopes to hand over to Europe and Britain responsibility for Ukraine’s security in the event of a cessation of hostilities, and responsibility for further military assistance. Given this, it is by no means clear what advantage such an agreement on rare earth metals would give Ukraine.

Trump’s claims that US mining on Ukrainian territory will be a sufficient guarantee of Ukraine’s security because Russia will not risk attacking US economic interests do not stand up to criticism. The Chinese state-owned COFCO corporation invested in a new grain and oil handling complex in Ukraine’s Mykolaiv port, but Chinese involvement did not protect the port from being targeted by Russian missiles. It has not been operational since March 2022 and the region is losing about 40% of its revenues.

The fact that Trump has been so complimentary about Vladimir Putin, and so hostile to Zelenskyy, says everything. “I think he will keep his word,” Trump assured the world. “I have known him for a long time.” Trump’s phrase that peace will be achieved “fairly soon or it won’t happen at all” indicates that he will not waste too much time on negotiations with Putin if they drag on, or if Putin puts forward conditions that are unacceptable to Ukraine. Some conditions have already been announced by Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, who reminded us that Russia still plans to seize the entirety of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.

Zelenskyy was brave, but we are supplicants now. Trump and the Kremlin have made it abundantly clear that Ukraine’s participation in these negotiations between the US and Russia is not necessary or desirable. Like so much else, the principle announced by Biden, “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”, has been trampled underfoot. Zelenskyy was called to the White House to sign, but not speak.

Trump has had his way. He has transformed Ukraine from a subject into an object, and after this White House humiliation some Ukrainians are convinced that the extraction of rare earth metals on Trump’s terms would turn our country into a “colony” of the US. Still, many Ukrainians would prefer to live in a US colony than in a Russian one, if that’s the choice."
"Black models, foreign films, queer culture – how the Face shaped me as a young man | Marc Thompson",['Marc Thompson'],2025-02-28,"I still remember the first copy of the Face magazine I bought at age 14. It was the January 1984 issue, with model and pop-rock singer Nick Kamen on the cover, in a ski cap. As a young kid, I bought magazines weekly, starting with Look-in, a preteen music and television magazine, followed by the brightly coloured teen bible Smash Hits and then the Face, the last two founded by Nick Logan. The Face was like a cool, older teenager who invited you into a sexy new world where fashion, music and design fused to create a revolutionary culture. As a young Black gay man, that invitation meant everything.

This truly was the heyday of magazines, as I was reminded when visiting The Face Magazine: Culture Shift at the National Portrait Gallery last week. I was moved to see all of the magazine covers and spreads that I had collected and hung up on the walls in my youth. There was a particular image of the Kiss FM crew in their studio with Norman Jay, Gordon Mac and Paul “Trouble” Anderson, DJs whom I had loved and followed. When I was 16 and had left school, the Face opened a window into London’s arts, music, clubbing, queer and fashion scene, which took me out of my small world in south London and allowed me to aspire to something different. Beyond the capital’s walls, the magazine introduced me to the emerging house music scene in Chicago and New York, and foreign-language films.

The 1980s and 90s are often described as something of a “monoculture”, a period in which there was a shared participation in cultural phenomena – people watching the same shows and consuming the same music. But the decades saw an explosion of youth subcultures, and the Face revealed and brought together different tribes that were previously siloed off – rockabillies, rude boys, skinheads, soul heads, goths. What was important to me as a young person was that the Face told you that you didn’t have to belong to one tribe; it could be cool for you to enjoy pop music and a bit of ska and a bit of soul.

The Face also did not simply report on culture, it shaped it, and it helped me build a sense of style and identity. Images created by the Buffalo movement, a fashion collective headed up by the stylist Ray Petri and the photographer Jamie Morgan, often filled the pages and the cover. Buffalo had drawn on Jamaican culture, dancehall music and hip-hop, and embraced sports labels such as Lacoste, Fila and Sergio Tacchini. It also pioneered playing around with gender representation – putting men into leather skirts with combat boots; choosing steely, masculine depictions of women over glitter and elegance.

The Face also used a diverse range of models, and had Black men as cover stars at a time when you would not see them in fashion stories or magazines anywhere else. It featured young Black male models now lost to history such as Tony Felix, Simon de Montfort and Wade Tolero. In June 1985, a month before I came out as gay to my family, the boxer Clinton McKenzie was on the cover of the Face in a beret with his muscles bursting out of his shorts and tank top. It’s an image I still love now.

That truly subversive, culture-defining era of magazines feels like a bygone era now. Perhaps I cannot claim, at age 55, to be completely tapped into the youth market, but the landscape of culture and the means of its dissemination are so much broader now. The decline of print magazines in the 2000s and 2010s was a consequence of the rise of the internet and social media, which spawned millions of cultural influencers and micro-trends. While magazines such as the Face weren’t gatekeepers of culture, they were published by a select few people who set the narrative. Trends now feel much less substantial and much less consequential for popular culture.

I remember being heartbroken when the Face closed down in 2004. While I had stopped collecting the magazine in the mid-90s, moving on to the more sophisticated GQ and Vanity Fair, it felt like one sign that we were entering a new era. The Face was founded at the beginning of the Thatcher era, and carried on through to New Labour and the explosion of Britpop. By the time it closed, the optimism of New Labour was crumbling, the advent of technology was not bringing the innovation and productivity gains for which we had hoped, and soon enough a financial crisis would appear on the horizon. The death of this truly British youth style bible – a symbol of growth, cultural revolution and promise – was the canary in the coalmine.

I have followed the Face from a distance since its relaunch in 2019 and am pleased to see it back. Perhaps magazines cannot shape culture in the same way as they did in my youth. The pursuit of clicks means magazines, with their additional digital presence, are now doomed to follow trends rather than set them. However, the preservation of definitive print products feels vital when our culture is dominated by an online world in which our attention is infinitely split and an identity is hard to establish. Perhaps I’ll go out and buy a copy again, even if I won’t have the foggiest what anything in there means any more.

"Well done for surviving the Trump test, PM. But our true friends are in Europe | Stella Creasy",['Stella Creasy'],2025-02-28,"If a week is a long time in politics, a week dominated by the fascination and fear as to what President Trump may do next is an eternity. Fresh off the plane from Washington, Keir Starmer will spend this weekend hosting the great and good of our continent as they take stock of prospects for Ukraine. For the third time since the second world war – after Suez in 1956 and Iraq in 2003 – the United Kingdom is being forced to work out where it stands between the US and Europe.

In the aftermath of those past crises, Britain chose to hug the US as tightly as possible, even if that meant drifting away from European friends. The prime minister appears to have secured a diplomatic coup in getting through his crunch encounter with Donald Trump mostly unscathed. But don’t let bonhomie and bad taste comments about wives fool you: we are still in crisis, and the old routine won’t save us.

Now is not the time for victory laps of the lobby over good headlines or the special relationship. If the past week has reinforced anything, it is how delicate are our prosperity and security, and that both now find stronger sustenance in Europe. The president may enjoy the pageantry of a second state visit, but six weeks into office he’s made it crystal clear his alliances are based not on grand ideals of shared values but profit margins. In negotiating with Vladimir Putin over Ukraine’s head while humiliating President Zelenskyy, Trump has shown that we can no longer assume that when push comes to shove, US core interests will align with ours.

Indeed, even hard interests appear negotiable if they interfere with the bottom line. Take critical minerals, the vital lifeblood of our advanced economies. Trump has strong-armed Zelenskyy into signing over preferential access to the revenues from Ukraine’s national deposits. This comes just weeks after the UK signed its own 100-year partnership with Ukraine that included plans to work together on these very same resources – a promise our government is yet to say can still hold. Meanwhile, there are reports that the US is gearing up to work directly with Russia to extract natural resources in the Arctic.

Trump may have restated his own liking for Brexit, but it has left us outside the room at a time of high peril. Every nation recognises the need to pour oil on the troubled waters of international affairs at present. Yet we cannot take for granted that our neighbours will be pleased to hear talk of exempting us from the same tariffs being used to threaten their own growth. With stakes this high, now is not the time to indulge rehashed scare stories about cooperation with Europe from the Conservatives, or ignore the vacillation over standing up to Putin from Reform. Nor should we be distracted by the perennial rabbit hole of whether to rejoin the EU – or let either side derail the reset of relationships by old enmities.

Instead of red lines, it’s time to talk shared interests. These will not be achieved if either side delays a new strategic trade partnership for the sake of arguments over fisheries policy. Nor can the UK be asked to fight for Europe, but at the same time be cut out of deals to finance crucial defence industries. British businesses need us to ruthlessly reduce the paperwork currently crippling trade with Europe. The British exchequer needs us to link our emissions trading schemes so that we won’t face a multibillion-pound bill when the EU’s new border charge comes into force. With energy security crucial to our ability to stand up to Putin as well as cutting the cost of living, there is also mutual interest in working at pace with our neighbours on the renewable energy potential of the North Sea – and to protect crucial undersea cables from sabotage.

History shows that when the UK has tried to please everyone, our international reputation – and influence – has diminished for decades afterwards. The prime minister has this week carefully walked a tightrope. It is a start, but it isn’t an answer as to how to secure our own interests in such uncertain times. From intelligence to nuclear weapons, our national security apparatus is tightly bound to the US. So, too, our volume of trade with Europe outweighs any hysteria about a hypothetical new deal with the US that could be years in negotiations.

Realpolitik requires cold, hard calculation now more than ever. Even if we can keep the special relationship intact, it is across the Channel, not the Atlantic, that Britain will need to look first to protect our citizens’ prosperity and security. After the circus, the real lion-taming starts now."
"Martin Rowson on Trump, Starmer, and uncomfortable new realities – cartoon",['Martin Rowson'],2025-02-28,"Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning"
"The BBC wanted black listeners and turned to Tim Westwood, white son of a vicar. A parable for our times | Jane Martinson",['Jane Martinson'],2025-02-28,"More than 30 years have passed since Tim Westwood joined the BBC, 12 since he left and three since Guardian and BBC journalists reported on allegations of abuse by a man considered by the corporation to be the voice of hip hop. Then this week, some of the many concerns raised during his 19 years working there were detailed in the latest edition of one of the BBC’s weightiest and longest-running series, Official Reports into Men We Employ Behaving Very Badly.

Westwood’s career at the Beeb ended in 2013, amid a flurry of accusations and a sense of deja vu best summarised as “oh God, not another one”. But the 174-page report is well worth reading, not just for what it says about the BBC but, as so often with the media, what it says about attitudes in Britain.

First, there’s the heartbreaking testimony from so many young women, mainly young Black women – claims of abuse that they say left them feeling so awful they blamed themselves or ended up contemplating suicide. Many did not realise the alleged behaviour was wrong until they were much older and admitted they didn’t report it at the time as they feared they would not be believed or would be blamed. The worst allegations are redacted because of ongoing police investigations. Westwood has denied all allegations of inappropriate behaviour and says he has not had the opportunity to answer the allegations, partly because of the ongoing police investigation.

Then there was the apparent blind-eye turning to let’s just call it dodgy behaviour by a man who was not only considered a star, but was one of just two BBC presenters in 1997 to have, according to BBC research “made an impact with young Black and Asian listeners”. Yes there are the many junior staff members who complained of bullying and harassment but ended up being moved instead of the main man, but there is also in this scandal the extra spice of the BBC’s patronising efforts to be not only down with the kids but down with Black and minority kids. Let’s call it the “Ali G factor”.

Westwood, the public school-educated son of an Anglican bishop turned pirate radio DJ, joined BBC Radio 1 in 1994 to launch the UK’s first national hip-hop radio show. He was described as a “dominant force” in rap music, a genre popular among the young people, particularly Black ones, who didn’t listen to the BBC. Both of the BBC Radio 1 controllers in charge during Westwood’s tenure mentioned the need for the BBC to attract this demographic. The Radio 1 controller between 1998 and 2001 described Westwood as being “bilingual”, able to speak to BBC management in a language they understood and could also “authentically connect” with a young minority audience. Westwood’s bad language and sexualised commentary was, according to a BBC executive quoted in the report “a sort of swaggering hip hop cartoon character”. When asked in 2017 for the highlights of his time running the station, Matthew Bannister started with “Westwood’s rammed stage at the Notting Hill carnival”.

So, in summary, the BBC hired the white, middle-class son of a vicar who affected the vulgar language of rappers (and once met the Notorious BIG and was, sort of, friends with Pharrell Williams) in an effort to increase cultural representation and appeal to Black and Asian listeners on the national broadcaster. Let that sink in. Could there be a greater example of the dangers of Auntie throwing all caution to the wind to be down with the kids, kids she feels are not her own, kids she doesn’t understand, kids she apparently made little genuine effort to understand?

The report leads to many conclusions, but one that seems inescapable is how much the BBC still needs diversity among its staff. It must be obvious this does not mean middle-aged posh white boys pretending to be Black. It means more people of colour, some of them minority women.

The problem of under-representation in the media is not unique to the BBC and at least the corporation has made strides to get better. In 2019 Lorna Clarke, a Black woman, became first, controller of pop and then director of music at the BBC. But despite a target of 20% minority ethnic staff, just 17% of its staff are not white.

The BBC response to this latest report shows that some things have been learned since the run of scandals going back to Savile in 2011. In a statement that outlined changed processes since and promised to do better, the BBC admitted that it had for too long “been too siloed [and] deferential to high profile individuals”. New processes for complaints to allow allegations to be looked at together rather than piecemeal are also in place. A review into its broader culture launched by Samir Shah, its first minority ethnic chair as well as a distinguished former journalist, will be produced by the end of this year.

This review should consider the culture of silence around inappropriate behaviour by many powerful men, some of whom were moulded and feted by the BBC. But it should also address the lazy thinking that led to this scandal, this trauma – continuing for so many victims – while everyone looked the other way.

The problem with saying “not again” is that we keep on having to say it."
Labour’s aid cuts are morally wrong. Here’s why they make no economic sense either | Larry Elliott,['Larry Elliott'],2025-02-28,"Get right down to it and there are two reasons for thinking that cuts to Britain’s aid budget to pay for defence are a seriously bad idea. The first is that people will die as a result. There will be less money to respond to humanitarian crises and less money for vaccination programmes and hospitals. Realpolitik is being blamed for the decision, but realpolitik doesn’t make it right.

But there are also economic arguments for rich countries providing financial support to less well-off nations, which were summed up succinctly in last year’s Labour party manifesto. This document could not have been clearer. International assistance, it said, helps make “the world a safer, more prosperous place”.

That remains as true as it was when Labour came to power last summer, and indeed it was still the party’s stated belief a month ago. When, as one of his first decisions, Donald Trump gutted the US aid budget, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, said it could be a “big strategic mistake”. Now that the UK has followed suit and reduced aid spending from 0.5% to 0.3% of national output, Lammy says it was a difficult but pragmatic decision. He was right before and is wrong now.

At its crudest, the economic case for overseas aid is that it is good for business. As countries become richer, they provide export opportunities for donor countries. The US has always understood this, with postwar Marshall aid for European reconstruction in part driven by fear of the spread of communism and in part as a means to provide markets for US goods. Under previous administrations, US humanitarian aid programmes have channelled agricultural surpluses into overseas food programmes.

In today’s world, it is no longer possible to think of aid spending and defence spending as discrete pots of money. Extreme poverty is increasingly concentrated in those parts of the world most seriously damaged by wars and the climate crisis. Five years ago, the global economy was about to be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, a shock from which the UK has yet to recover. Ministers need to ask themselves a simple question: does cutting the aid budget make another worldwide health emergency more or less likely?

Poor countries need help to boost economic development more than ever. They havebeen hard hit by the double whammy of Covid and the higher food prices triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine three years ago. A new debt crisis is looming, and both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have been warning that money that could and should be spent on schools, hospitals and building protection against the effects of the climate emergency is instead being spent paying back creditors.

The Labour governments headed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown spearheaded previous debt relief efforts and were able to do so because Britain showed a strong commitment to overseas assistance. A new Department for International Development was set up, a goal was set of meeting the UN aid target of 0.7% of national income, and there was a clear gameplan. Spending more on aid was good for poor countries, but it was also good for rich countries such as Britain. It was a classic example of the exercise of soft power. Britain punched well above its weight when development issues were discussed at the IMF and World Bank.

The world is a lot more fragile and divided than it was in the early years of this century, when growth was strong and the era of financial crises and global pandemics was still in the future. With the US and China locked in a battle for economic supremacy, the battle is on to capture hearts and minds. Seen in this context, the UK’s decision to follow the US lead on aid spending is shortsighted. It will merely make poor countries more susceptible to offers of assistance from Beijing.

None of which is to say that every penny of aid is well spent. Yes, there is waste, as there is with defence spending. But in making the choice it has, the government has effectively bought into the rightwing argument that aid does more harm than good and traps poor people into a dependency culture. Labour needs to be careful. The right says the same about the welfare state, which will be next on its list of targets.

There is a case for higher defence spending. It is a more dangerous world and Britain can no longer rely on the US to provide guaranteed military support. But let’s be clear. The reason the aid budget is being cut to pay for the armed forces is not because it is the best way to raise money but because it is the easiest. The government is calculating that it will get far less grief from voters – especially Labour voters flirting with Reform UK – this way.

There are alternatives. Rachel Reeves could increase taxes on the wealthy. If the need is really as urgent as the government says, then the chancellor could justify borrowing more. A truly progressive government would be reviving the idea of a Robin Hood tax on speculative financial transactions to meet its manifesto pledge of raising aid spending back to 0.7% of national income.

Instead, Starmer has done the reverse of a Robin Hood tax. Shamefully, he is balancing the books courtesy of the poorest people in the world. This will not make the world a safer and more prosperous place. The exact opposite, in fact."
"After a week of turmoil, one thing needs saying about our NHS: slowly it is healing | Polly Toynbee",['Polly Toynbee'],2025-02-28,"Reorganisation – or re-disorganisation – is the perennial disease in the NHS. If I listed all the structural acronyms throughout the decades, and the new staff starting new jobs with new brass nameplates, it would fill this page.

This week, Wes Streeting accepted the resignation of NHS England’s chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, after ousting its chair, Richard Meddings, signalling an effective merger in all but name with Streeting’s own department. Whitehall says NHS England will have “a smaller, leaner role”, with thousands of duplicated jobs lost.

Few people will regret the swallowing up of this remnant of the disastrous 2012 Lansley reforms, which fragmented everything in the NHS. Pritchard and Meddings recently suffered an unwarranted pasting by the Commons public accounts and health committees for their lack of “ideas”, but that was hardly fair. They had been barred from revealing the health department’s imminent 10-year plan. And there is a truth that the committees ignored that bears stating here: the NHS is on the turn for the better.

Jim Mackey takes over NHS England, and even those who say Pritchard got the push unfairly tell me they welcome his arrival. Currently CEO of Newcastle hospitals foundation trust, he was head of NHS Improvement with a record of innovation until it was abolished by one of the three Tory health secretaries passing through in 2022. It’s also worth saying that Pritchard suffered six changes of health secretary in three and half years.

I interviewed Mackey two years ago when he had returned to Northumbria healthcare trust, to start a pioneering scheme that others now copy. Failure to bind social care with the NHS leaves more than 13,000 beds in England taken up by old people waiting for a care package.

Mackey set up a care system within his trust to relieve hospital bed shortages. His Northumbria Care is an NHS-owned domiciliary service that bids for social care contracts from local authorities that would usually be awarded to private providers, seamlessly integrating care within the health service. Here is a smooth transition without bottlenecks between the two sectors, with health and social care funded from the same budget, and every incentive to stop patients needing a hospital bed, and to get them home quicker.

He planned to build care homes to take over residential contracts too, if he could raise the capital.

The idea short-circuits the cumbersome introduction of 42 integrated care boards (ICBs). They were designed to bring local services together, but are largely regarded as failing. They lack the clout to knock local heads together so that GP and community services integrate with hospitals. They have no power over integrating local authority social care. Half the ICBs are in debt; they may yet be merged into half that number.

Rarely has top talent moved from hospitals to run ICBs. Instead, many hospitals are forming groups, which may work better than ICBs. These are not big-bang changes and they slide under the radar, but the Mackey model has inspired other trusts to try similar schemes: expect more of that thinking from him.

8:48 ‘Fix poverty, fix health’: A day in the life of a ‘failing’ NHS

The Darzi report laid bare the state of the NHS Labour inherited. Austerity cut everything, including medical training, with huge gaps in staff as the NHS struggled to cope with the effects of deprivation and a far sicker population.

Streeting is rightly wary of boasting about any progress yet, given public outrage over the still appalling waiting lists (7.46 million cases, according to the British Medical Association), as well as ambulance delays, and ailing A&E and GP services. The Treasury, meanwhile, seems happy to say that NHS productivity is lagging and that extra money ploughed in is failing to produce enough improvement. But that’s not the whole story, and the NHS should speak up. The Treasury traditionally sees the NHS as a bottomless pit, but its productivity is being badly misrepresented with faulty Office for National Statistics figures that are eagerly seized on by enemies of the NHS on the right.

Anita Charlesworth, senior economist at the Health Foundation thinktank, says ONS figures only count acute hospital activity, leaving out the 12,000 new virtual hospital-at-home beds. These are costly, but less expensive than actual hospital beds. The stats leave out GP care. Productivity there is rising fast now that GPs are paid to seek advice from specialists, instead of automatically referring patients to them directly: 1.5 million fewer patients have been referred, the department tells me. Instead, they are being cared for in surgeries under guidance. That GP productivity should be counted in.

The department’s own figures show waiting lists falling and the 2m extra appointments promised within a year have been provided months early, with surgical hubs working evenings and weekends, as well as new diagnostic units.

In his last month as chair, Meddings points to widespread improvements, a service “overwhelmed”, but not “broken”, he tells me. GP appointments are rising fast: 98% of surgeries have digital phones ensuring every call is answered, or called back promptly, with half the callers getting same-day appointments, and 70% face-to-face consultations. April’s year end figures will show “NHS productivity up 2.5%, more than any other public service”, Meddings said. He echoed the curious optimism you often hear throughout the NHS, even from those who describe near-impossible tasks undertaken to cope with rising need.

Keep perspective. Trolleys line many A&E corridors, ambulance delays persist, waiting times are horrendous. I hear laments from managers and medics facing the prospect of 4% “efficiency savings” next year, to be achieved on top of already existing deficits, which must also be cleared. (Spoiler alert: they won’t be.)

But there is hope. Times are tough and funding remains below the NHS historic average. But, as the Health Foundation’s Charlesworth says, this is not a repeat of the NHS austerity years.

Statistics are just that, and what they represent cuts through very slowly, so it will take a long time before the public feels and believes in progress. But, for all the turmoil, green shoots are there."
"Trump can’t fulfil his promise to fix the economy, so he’s blaming workers instead",['Malaika Jabali'],2025-02-28,"During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump never missed an opportunity to harp on inflation, promising that “on day one” he would “end inflation” and lower the costs of groceries, cars and other common goods.

Well, it’s day 40, and inflation saw its largest increase in over a year. Blink and you might have missed that Trump and his fellow Republicans have largely abandoned their concerns about inflation to focus on government “waste”.

While Trump hasn’t fulfilled his campaign promise, he is living up to his usual brand of politics: the blame game. And this blame, as usual, is rooted in generating anger against “undeserving” Americans.

This time, the undeserving are federal workers and poor people who get nominal benefits from the federal government – like Snap, which administers food stamps, and Medicaid. To fix so-called waste, the president apparently has no choice but to crack down on spending (and enlist help from Elon Musk), an issue that barely registered in the public consciousness in the past 10 years but is somehow now a rampant problem, according to Trump.

There are policy frameworks backing Trump and the GOP’s divisiveness, including the well-known Project 2025 and a lesser-known House proposal published in 2024, Fiscal Sanity to Save America, that centers government “waste” instead of corporate greed. And now, with Republicans controlling the House, Senate and presidency, Republicans have the power to act on cuts that will harm millions of Americans.

Musk and Trump, of course, have already worked to cut thousands of federal workers’ jobs. And with the Trump-backed budget bill the House passed on Wednesday, including $800bn in likely cuts from Medicaid, Republicans are one step closer to bulldozing America’s already paltry social safety net.

This isn’t just at the federal level. Republicans have been floating proposals in state governments that would restrict healthcare, housing and food benefits instead of making it easier to afford things.

The party of “freedom” is endorsing government home visits to surveil “fraud” in all US states (according to page 43 of the GOP’s “Fiscal Sanity” plan). The party of “family values” is also turning its attention to school lunch and breakfast programs, which it claims are subject to “widespread” fraud and abuse (page 46). The party that wants to “make America healthy again” is floating restrictions to Medicaid that would make recipients work at least 80 hours a month, a proposal that wastes government time and money to verify work requirements and which would probably just deter people from getting healthcare, as a flailing GOP work requirement experiment in Georgia has shown.

And as Trump touts himself as an anti-war president, his proposals belie the fact that much of these spending cuts will now be diverted to defense contracts and other military and border spending, not on improving the economic lives of everyday workers to whom he made sweeping campaign promises.

Meanwhile, straightforward proposals to simply give people more money (which does have evidence of working), such as universal basic income, would be outright banned at the federal level under the GOP plan. So as the cost of living is primed to increase, Republicans have ready-made excuses to justify cutting billions of dollars from these programs, an exceptional sort of cruelty.

Focusing on extreme examples animates America’s propensity for divisiveness, giving Republicans wide latitude to wreck the lives of millions

Of course, no one wants to see public money being spent wastefully or fraudulently. But incessant focus on “waste” stems from faulty, selective evidence. According to reports from Musk’s own so-called “department of government efficiency”, nearly 40% of cancelled contracts to cut costs are expected to yield no savings. It also stems from something else that does have proven results: the utility of public outrage.

Focusing on extreme examples and “undeserving” government beneficiaries animates America’s existing propensity for divisiveness, giving Trump and his party wide latitude to wreck the lives of millions of people who don’t engage in fraud, waste or abuse. When Reagan wanted tax cuts for the rich, we saw the “welfare queen” trope. When neoliberal Democrats and Republicans wanted to cut public housing at the federal and local level, we saw extreme stories about the criminality of people who lived there. We cannot waste the money of hard-working Americans on these “others”. It’s a narrative – often hinging on racism and sexism – that has great outcomes for America’s capitalist class and the politicians who support them.

So instead of protesting against the rising cost of living or making demands for universal healthcare, federal job guarantees, increased labor rights, or Snap benefits for all, or cutting the bloated defense budget and increasing taxes on the super-rich to pay for the nominal social welfare benefits that other industrial countries have normalized, working-class Americans are engaging in petty debates about what kinds of groceries other working-class Americans should buy and deputizing themselves to root out “abuse” among other workers.

Republicans redirecting blame towards people who are suffering in this economy under the guise of “waste” is a distraction. As inflation is poised to worsen under Trump, Americans would be wise to focus their anger more on the elected officials and billionaires who profit from their pain than on each other."
The Guardian view on PM’s gamble: exploiting crisis to remake Labour was a step too far for an ally | Editorial,[],2025-02-28,"The resignation of Anneliese Dodds, the international development minister, from Labour’s cabinet may not have been entirely unexpected. Sir Keir Starmer’s decision to cut the aid budget to “pay” for increased defence spending was wrong. Making the world’s poorest foot the bill for Britain’s security is reckless and self-defeating. Slashing aid fuels instability – it won’t buy safety. From her perch in government Ms Dodds, who was Sir Keir’s first shadow chancellor, knew this better than most.

The former cabinet minister’s letter is right to warn that the cuts will mean the UK withdrawing from many developing countries and having a diminished role in global institutions like the World Bank, the G7 and climate negotiations. She pointedly argued Britain will find it “impossible” to deliver on its commitment to maintain development spending in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine with the shrunken budget. Sir Keir rebuffed this charge, but Ms Dodds is right to say his move is being seen as following the Trumpian lead in cutting USAid – a framing that implies the UK is losing its independent foreign policy direction.

Like many others, including this column, she understood that in an increasingly volatile world, defence spending must rise. But rather than a collective discussion on whether the government’s fiscal rules and tax policies remain fit for purpose, the prime minister chose to gut aid budgets to fund defence spending with little debate, as if stability abroad weren’t essential to security at home. Such high-handed treatment left Ms Dodds, a soft-left intellectual politician, with no choice but to resign.

Her departure had been in the air since Sir Keir made his announcement – but she held off until he returned from Washington. Sir Keir now owns the decision, and its consequences will define his leadership. That he was shaped by events rather than shaping them will not be lost on his MPs.

Clive Lewis, a leftwing Labour MP and former soldier, has called for a wealth tax to fund defence. This is a sensible idea that merits wider discussion, as does relaxing borrowing rules – a debate already under way in Europe. The party’s right wing wants to frame Sir Keir’s move as more than fiscal, briefing that Sir Keir has made a deliberate break from the party’s pro-aid stance. It is reported that the Treasury didn’t push this – it was the prime minister’s personal call. Ms Dodds’ rise and fall mirrors his hardening leadership style.

Sir Keir is seizing this crisis to remake his party. His government has embraced militarisation, welfare cuts, climate backtracking and nationalist asylum policies. The political rationale is to ward off attacks from the extreme right and particularly Reform, which has seen its support rise. Why amplify rightwing narratives instead of challenging them? If this is just tactical positioning, fine. If not, he risks losing Labour’s soul – a perilous path as concerns over the lack of good jobs, equality, child poverty and pensioner support are likely to keep growing. Labour voters may turn away if “hard-headed” geopolitics trumps fairness. The reaction from MPs and the electorate will determine whether this gamble pays off – or exposes rifts within Labour’s coalition."
The Guardian view on Zelenskyy in Washington: Trump turns his fire on the beleaguered president,[],2025-02-28,"Europe hoped that concerted efforts could have some effect in bringing round Donald Trump to a more reasonable position on Ukraine, and mitigate the worst of his administration’s instincts. After the combined persuasion and flattery of Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron brought out a somewhat tamer and more jovial version of the US president, there were modest hopes that the Ukrainian president’s visit to Washington might be more productive than feared – even if there was no sign that they had succeeded in tempting Mr Trump towards the security assurances so desperately needed.

Instead, within minutes of Volodymyr Zelenskyy arriving at the White House, the men’s discussion in the Oval Office exploded into a shouting match. Mr Trump had earlier spoken of partnership with the Ukrainian president. But he and his vice-president, JD Vance, teamed up to deliver a public kicking. It would, the president added, be “great television”.

8:25 In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – video

“You are gambling with world war three,” Mr Trump accused him. He attacked Mr Zelenskyy’s “hatred” for Vladimir Putin, suggesting it was the obstacle to achieving peace – no mention of Russia’s invasion. So much for Mr Trump’s remark that “I’m in the middle, I’m for both Ukraine and Russia” – itself a shameful pronouncement. It is hard to see how the curtailed visit – Mr Trump said that Mr Zelenskyy “can come back when he is ready for peace” – could have gone worse. “President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” Mr Trump wrote.

Europe’s charm initiative was always a long shot. Like Mr Macron, Sir Keir enjoyed a jovial reception from Mr Trump. He had learned to speak his language. Having arrived armed with an invitation for a second state visit, he gushed that Donald Trump’s return to Britain would be “so incredible. It will be historic.” He also managed to speak the truth: he stressed that peace must not reward the aggressor and factchecked the president’s lie that European aid to Ukraine was merely loaned. Asked about Mr Trump’s vision for Gaza, he stated the need for Palestinians to return home and reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to the two-state solution.

Mr Trump, in affable mode, suggested he would probably back the UK’s plan to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. He dangled the prospect of a bilateral trade deal, but its substance remains unclear – and likely skewed in America’s favour.

It would have been folly for Sir Keir to burn bridges. But it was always clear that Mr Trump would be ready to set the torch to them himself whenever he saw fit. And so on Friday he put the boot into a democratically elected leader fighting to defend his country against invasion – “You don’t have the cards,” he told Mr Zelenskyy – yet has said he believes that Mr Putin can be trusted to keep promises. No one else does, which is why a security backstop from the US is needed.

The minerals deal that Kyiv was set to sign with Washington smacks more of a shakedown than a partnership. Mr Trump’s suggestion that American workers mining those resources could be the backstop against further Russian aggression was both a reminder of his priorities and further confirmation that he will not offer anything more substantive. Then came his blistering attack on Mr Zelenskyy.

Sunday’s defence summit of European leaders in London is now more crucial than ever. The extent of their erstwhile ally’s betrayal is now undeniable. Kyiv is the first but not the only victim. (His chummy meeting with Mr Macron on Monday did not stop Mr Trump from subsequently claiming that the EU was “formed to screw the United States”.) The extent to which European countries are able to formulate a plan for acting accordingly, and in unison, will be critical to Ukraine’s future, and to the continent’s."
Boosting public funding is the only way to make the arts more inclusive,[],2025-02-28,"Your article (Working-class creatives don’t stand a chance in UK today, leading artists warn, 21 February) suggests that the higher percentage of privately educated people in leadership roles in the arts is due to a “rigged system” that shuts out working-class people, yet, despite highlighting the fall in students taking arts and humanities subjects, it fails to draw the obvious conclusion.

When provision of arts tuition in the state sector has almost disappeared, young people who are unable to pay for private tuition and whose schools don’t have art or drama departments are hugely disadvantaged from the outset if they wish for a career in the arts. How can children explore and gain confidence in their creative potential if they can’t test it in an art department, music room or on an assembly hall stage?

Receiving support from teachers and practitioners who know from experience how to develop artistic or performative careers can be transformative, but governments of all stripes devalue the arts and humanities in schools and further education, and heads juggling their budget choose not to allocate staffing to art, drama or music.

It is much less fair to rely on fortune – perhaps having family members who already work in the relevant field, or living somewhere with access to after-school activities, creative writing workshops or drama groups. For the past 20 years at least, regional theatres, museums, opera companies and those working in arts and culture charities have rightly made huge efforts to widen access and address inequalities.

If the culture secretary wants a more diverse workforce in the arts, a good start would be to increase public funding for arts education, particularly in regions where provision is scarce. Presenting the issue as one of upper-class privilege is facile and misleading – sustained investment by government in the next generation of potential cultural leaders now, enabling schools, colleges, cultural organisations and charities that deliver creative programmes to extend their reach, could be the key.

Cathy Baxandall

Ilkley, West Yorkshire

Your article on the crisis facing working-class creatives highlights the urgent need for sustained public investment in the arts. Without it, we risk shutting out a generation of talent. Exposure to the arts fosters creativity, confidence and critical thinking – skills essential not just for the creative industries, but for every sector. Yet access to theatre is becoming increasingly unequal, with parents and teachers reporting a decline in school trips, particularly in deprived areas where rising transport costs create additional barriers.

Theatre staff across the country are working hard to bridge this gap, running outreach programmes, youth drama clubs and creative projects that introduce thousands of young people to the magic of live performance. But without public investment, their impact is limited. That is why the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre are championing the Theatre for Every Child campaign – to break down barriers to attendance and ensure that all children, regardless of their background, have the chance to engage with live performance.

As the culture secretary rightly said: “Every child and adult should also have the opportunity to access live theatre, dance and music – to believe that these spaces belong to them and are for them.” With proper investment and commitment, we can make that vision a reality.

Your article asks why the arts are not an attractive career choice for those from a working-class background. Having served on the boards of two theatres, the greatest problem we faced in hiring staff was the inability to offer competitive salaries. If you come from a less privileged background, why would you opt to work in an industry that would condemn you to live in relative poverty?

When Britain was hot on manufacturing – and kettle design,[],2025-02-28,"I was pleased to read Edward Posnett’s review (19 February) of Tim Minshall’s Your Life Is Manufactured . Little attention is currently paid to manufacturing, perhaps because it comprises only 8% of British GDP.

The opening of the review focuses on the domestic kettle, Posnett emphasising that the “tocks” of automatic kettles switching off are as significant for us as the nightingale’s song was for John Keats. But despite this cultural significance, no electric kettles are made in Britain now.

Posnett’s discussion of the kettle comes from a case study in Minshall’s book. Minshall describes how John Crawshaw Taylor, and his company, Strix Controls, manufacture the thermostats that switch off automatic kettles all over the world. While Taylor invented the modern form of kettle thermostat, he did not invent the automatic kettle. My father, Bill Russell, took out the first patent to switch off a boiling kettle in 1955. With his business partner, Peter Hobbs, he founded Russell Hobbs in 1952 and from 1955 built automatic kettles in a small factory in south London. In 1960, the firm bought out the iconic K2 design, which was in production for 20 years, gracing wedding gift lists well into the 1970s.

Protected by patent, Russell Hobbs had a monopoly. Other manufacturers had a strong incentive to get round the Russell Hobbs patent. The man who broke it was John C Taylor in the late 1960s, more than a decade after Russell Hobbs began making automatic kettles. Taylor spotted a flaw in their thermostat patent and devised a way round it. Taylor and Strix have subsequently been successful, rare stories of modern British manufacturing achievement.

It is a pity that the postwar generation of British design innovators, epitomised by Bill Russell, have been forgotten. Russell Hobbs persists, as does another British brand, Morphy Richards. John Taylor and James Dyson are famous contemporary inventors and designers. Equally significant earlier industrial designers, such as Bill Russell and Donal Morphy of Morphy Richards, are hardly remembered. Bill and Peter anticipated that they might be forgotten even if their firm survived. They considered themselves mere “household names” rather than notable individuals.

I tell their story in my book Household Names: Russell Hobbs and the Automatic Kettle – A Story of Invention and Design.

Aston Villa v Cardiff City: FA Cup fifth round – live,['Simon Burnton'],2025-02-28,"now 20.48 GMT Half time: Aston Villa 0-0 Cardiff City 45+2 mins: Rashford sends in a corner, which falls at the feet of a Villa player but he’s facing the wrong direction and backheels into a defener. And that is basically that. Share

2m ago 20.45 GMT 45+1 mins: There will be one minute of stoppage time. Share

2m ago 20.45 GMT 45 mins: I’ve now seen a replay of that Cardiff penalty appeal and, well, I’ve seen them given. Bogarde kicks Ng’s foot, and maybe he was a little overkeen to go down, but it looked a bit fouly to me. Share

4m ago 20.44 GMT 44 mins: And the 27th and 28th should have brought the breakthrough! Rashford heads the ball through to Watkins, who should have sent it either side of Horvath but instead sidefoots into him! Share

5m ago 20.43 GMT 43 mins: Villa are now 26-1 up on touches-in-opponents’-penalty-area. Share

5m ago 20.42 GMT Cardiff touch the ball in the Villa penalty area! 42 mins: This is not a drill. The ball is chipped through to Ng, running into the box, who takes a touch and then goes down as Lamare Bogarde challenges. The referee hasn’t given the penalty, and play has continued.

6m ago 20.41 GMT 41 mins: Cardiff do an attack! Giles leads it on the left, and the ball is worked to El Ghazi, about 25 yards out, who gets a little excited and takes a rubbish shot that rolls wide. Share

9m ago 20.38 GMT 38 mins: I don’t know if ITV have placed their microphones a little mischievously, but I’ve only been able to hear Cardiff’s fans so far. Share

13m ago 20.35 GMT 34 mins: Bailey gets to the byline and thumps the ball across goal. It flies to Rashford at the back post, but he can’t get his foot over the ball and as a result does get the ball over the bar! Share

14m ago 20.34 GMT 33 mins: Save! A long diagonal pass to Asensio, whose control is ludicrously good but whose pass infield goes straight to Goutas. He half-clears to Bailey, who lashes a shot goalwards that Horvath beats away. Share

17m ago 20.30 GMT 31 mins: A third of the game has been played, and Villa have had a lot of the ball but just one chance. “Is it just me or is there a kit clash here? I’m finding it hard to distinguish between the dark tops and white shorts. Why are they allowed to wear such similar colours?” wails Katharine. “Or maybe it’s just that Specsavers is calling me. I might book an appointment just to be on the safe side.” Both teams are wearing white shorts, but I’m finding the Cardiff blue and the Villa claret different enough not to get very confused.

19m ago 20.29 GMT 29 mins: A pause while Robinson receives treatment after running into El Ghazi. Share

19m ago 20.29 GMT 28 mins: Horvath dallies on the ball and then very nearly sidefoots it straight into Watkins with his left foot. Luckily the ball only grazes the Villa striker, and he gets away with it. Share

21m ago 20.27 GMT 25 mins: The ball is played over the top of Villa’s defence towards El Ghazi, who goes down in the area under challenge from Maatsen. Cardiff look to the referee hoping for a penalty; he signals an offside. Share

24m ago 20.24 GMT 24 mins: Villa have executed 74 successful passes in the final third. Cardiff have had one. Share

26m ago 20.21 GMT 21 mins: Another pull-back from Rashford, but this time he’s pulling back Ng and Cardiff have a free kick and a bit of a breather. Share

27m ago 20.20 GMT 20 mins: The ball is spending almost all of its time in Cardiff’s defensive third. Rashford does well on the left again and pulls back to Tielemans, but Ramsey throws himself in the way of the shot! Share

30m ago 20.17 GMT 18 mins: Chance! Watkins is played in to the left of goal and tries to prod a shot past Horvath, but the keeper gets something on it and the ball dribbles wide! Share

31m ago 20.17 GMT 17 mins: Another clever corner from Villa. It drops to Rashford, a couple of yards inside the penalty area, but he misses his kick. Share

31m ago 20.16 GMT 15 mins: Cardiff continue to defend their area pretty well, but Villa’s attacking has been a bit imprecise so far – it feels like they’ve been as responsible for their moves breaking down as Cardiff’s defenders, but at some point they’re going to go a whole move without messing up. Share

35m ago 20.13 GMT 12 mins: … from which Villa attempt to produce something they presumably worked on on the training pitches, and which presumably worked a bit better when they did. This time it’s played to Bailey, but badly enough for a Cardiff player to intercept it and boot clear. Share

36m ago 20.12 GMT 11 mins: Now Rashford jinks and sprints to the byline, but his cross is cut out and deflects behind for a corner. Share

41m ago 20.06 GMT 6 mins: A nice cross from the left almost does the trick, but Bailey can’t quite reach it at the far post. Share

42m ago 20.06 GMT 5 mins: Cardiff have dropped into a 5-4-1 formation when Villa have the ball, two lines on the edge of their penalty area, challenging Villa to find a way through them. Share

45m ago 20.03 GMT 3 mins: The ball breaks to Bailey in the box, and he executes a very snazzy 360-degree spin. Doesn’t lead to much, but must have felt awesome. Share

46m ago 20.02 GMT 2 mins: Perry Ng takes an age over a throw-in, and then chucks it at a teammate off whom it bounces into touch. Share

47m ago 20.00 GMT 1 min: Peeeeeeep! Cardiff get the ball rolling. Share

48m ago 20.00 GMT The players are no longer in the tunnel. They’re on the pitch and Cardiff are huddling as I type. Villa don’t bother with that kind of thing. Anyway, football imminent! Share

52m ago 19.55 GMT The players are in the tunnel, where the referee is laying down some ground rules for the two captains. Share

We know how tough it’s going to be. Hopefully it’ll be a memorable night for us. We know how difficult it’ll be but hopefully we’ll have one of those special FA Cup evenings.” Share

1h ago 19.44 GMT “We want to be as competitive as we can be in this game,” says the Cardiff manager Omer Riza, who has given the 19-year-old defender Dylan Lawlor a full debut. “They’ve put out a strong side so … it should be interesting. Anything can happen in the FA Cup. It’s a one-off situation. If we turn up and we do everything right that we can, you never know. It’s good character building.” Share

"Plymouth’s Maksym Talovierov: ‘When the fans cheer, it just goes inside of me’",['Ben Fisher'],2025-02-28,"Suddenly talking about celebrating tackles with gladiatorial grace and the prospect of swapping shirts with Erling Haaland feels rather insignificant. Maksym Talovierov, known as Maxi, is detailing the sobering reality of life since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “It’s really hard because for three years every morning I wake up and I see a lot of notifications about rockets and missiles in every city, including Kyiv, where my parents are,” the Plymouth defender says. “I text them immediately to see how they’re doing. ‘Are you in the [underground] car park? Are you in the metro?’ Because when they [Russia] are bombing and it’s dangerous, that’s where they go because they are the closest things to safe zones.”

The 24-year-old has not seen his mother, Maryna, and father, Vadym, a former professional footballer, for three and a half years. “Sometimes they might not have a connection or wifi and then it’s stressful because they don’t respond and you don’t know what’s going on. On the news it might say: ‘In this area of Kyiv, five rockets.’ But you never know exactly where.

“Yeah,” Talovierov says, taking a breath, “it’s a really hard situation. Some of our soldiers are my friends, friends of friends, parents of international teammates. They joined the army to help our country and I appreciate it a lot.”

There will be 7,800 Plymouth fans in the away end at Manchester City on Saturday evening keen to show Talovierov support in the FA Cup fifth round. He has already felt the love around the place he now calls home. He tells a story about a couple sparing him a wasted walk into the city centre to create a bank account. “About 50 metres before the bank I realised that I forgot my passport,” he says. “Some fans who recognised me and wanted to have a picture said: ‘If you need anything, we can always help you.’ So I said: ‘Guys, can you please drop me to my hotel and back because I forgot my passport?’ The man moved to the back seat: ‘Maxi, sit here in the front seat, my wife will drop you back.’ They shared a lot of stories about the history of the club and the city during these five minutes in the car.”

The ponytailed centre-back, a £1.4m buy from the Austrian club Lask, has earned cult-hero status among Plymouth supporters in the 28 days since he became the Championship club’s record signing. He completed his medical at Home Park at midnight, signed his contract at 1am and returned for training hours later. His debut came the next day in a victory against West Brom. Before his man-of-the-match performance he limbered up by doing press-ups in the tunnel and during the game he toasted perfectly timed challenges with double fist-pumps. “This match will be in my head until my last days. The following evening I was just walking around the streets and fans were screaming at me: ‘Maxi! Maxi!’ I had a hat on so I don’t even know how they realised it was me.”

There were more hulking celebrations after thwarting Luis Díaz and Kostas Tsimikas when Plymouth shocked Liverpool in the previous round. The council lit Smeaton’s Tower on Plymouth Hoe in a green hue to mark the occasion.“Sometimes I don’t remember doing it [celebrating] … then I see videos when scrolling TikTok or Instagram reels and I’m surprised: ‘Ooo, I don’t remember.’ I don’t even recognise that it’s me. I might remember the tackle but not the celebration. I really like that it comes from my soul. When the fans cheer, it just goes inside of me,” he says, slowly raising both hands towards his chest. “I don’t think about it before games: ‘When I defend, I will scream.’ No, I’m very emotional on the pitch. You never know when it will come to you.”

Another Plymouth defender, Nikola Katic, lost one of his front teeth in the heat of battle against Liverpool, though the groundsman discovered it post-match. “But I think he was still happy … we were all laughing about it. Niko is a warrior; he doesn’t worry about these things. After the game I slept a few hours because I was so tired and then all night I couldn’t sleep because of this adrenaline in my head. I think we didn’t even have enough energy to celebrate much because we were so tired. Against teams like Liverpool you have to be concentrated, focused all the time.”

Talovierov was born in Nalchik, a Russian city close to the Georgian border, where his father, also a defender, played briefly, but the family moved to Donetsk three months later and lived there until 2014, when Russia-backed separatist groups ignited conflict there. “Shakhtar moved their academy to Kyiv, and that’s why we moved to Kyiv. My parents lost their business in Donetsk because it was captured and moved to Kyiv to help me.”

Now Vadym, who watched one of his son’s games at Euro 2024 from the safety of a Kyiv underground station while Russia bombed the city, works as Talovierov’s analyst. “He is preparing a lot of information about the [opposition] strikers, my strengths, my weaknesses, good and bad things. From the age of seven, he was at every training session, he would join in the training and then just watch, analyse and on the way home from the stadium he would highlight good moments, bad moments and the things I needed to improve. Sometimes I was really angry because when you’re a teenager listening to advice you think you’re always right. Now I understand how important it was.”

A possible duel with Haaland awaits. “A few months ago I played on the PlayStation as Haaland and as them [City]. Last year I played Fifa more and I really loved him because I played a lot with him in my Ultimate Team.” For Talovierov, the ultimate inspiration is Virgil van Dijk, whom he played against when Lask faced Liverpool in the Europa League in 2023-24. After Talovierov missed out on Van Dijk’s shirt in Austria, the Dutchman promised to give him his shirt at Anfield.

Van Dijk stayed true to his word. “One of my teammates wanted to take the jersey from Virgil but Virgil said: ‘No, no, no, because I promised Maxi,’ and he pointed at me. I was really surprised because it was two months later and imagine how many players ask Virgil for his jersey. He showed me the person I want to be in a few years, and that if I promise something, I will do it.”

Talovierov is one of several Ukraine internationals flying the flag for their country in England, including Illia Zabarnyi at Bournemouth and Oleksandr Zinchenko at Arsenal. He is good friends with Mykhailo Mudryk of Chelsea. “I know [Andriy] Shevchenko and Zinchenko created a charity match [Game4Ukraine] at Stamford Bridge. I know Mudryk helps a lot but you will not find it in newspapers. I don’t know one player who doesn’t want to help. Everyone does their maximum to help.”

Talovierov is softly spoken but makes his point. “Of course, every day is so hard and sometimes you try to find a few things to make you smile a bit. It would be easy to be serious and think about the war all the time but then you can destroy yourself mentally. Hopefully it will finish as fast as possible and we will win. It will finish how we want. Hopefully.”"
McCullum’s challenge now is to find more than just a new England captain,['Ali Martin'],2025-02-28,"Once Jos Buttler walked into the press conference room at Karachi’s National Stadium on Friday night, flanked by Brendon McCullum, what followed was no surprise. This Champions Trophy was always make or break for England’s white-ball captain and, after two defeats extinguished any semi-final hopes, the latter won out.

The cat was pretty much out of the bag two nights earlier in Lahore when, slightly shell-shocked from England’s failed run chase against Afghanistan, Buttler said he would be considering his future. When a captain begins openly asking whether they are “part of the problem” – Buttler’s words that evening – the story rarely ends any other way.

After arriving in Karachi 24 hours later, scene of Saturday’s final group game against South Africa, Buttler flicked McCullum a message asking him to come to his room for a chat. Knowing what this was likely to mean, the head coach initially thought about persuading him otherwise. Instead, stopping to think for a moment, McCullum accepted it was time.

Thereafter it was about informing the players, the pair announcing it in the team room at the hotel the next day before the bus set off for training. Joe Root was originally slated to speak to the media, with the sight of Buttler and McCullum striding across the floodlit outfield offering the first hint that something more significant was coming.

The good news, McCullum stressed, is that after leading the team out one last time, Buttler intends to carry on as a player. As well as flatlining results, and the loss of two world titles in the past 18 months, this may be the crux. The runs have worryingly dried up for Buttler at the past three major events but, even aged 34 and with his market value in the franchise world still high, he remains unsated in an England shirt.

To that end, Buttler said he wanted to learn from Joe Root on how best to operate as a former captain. Root’s time in charge of the Test team – the final days of which bore striking similarities to these past few weeks – has been followed by some of the most golden years of his career under Ben Stokes. Right now, England having lost their aura in white-ball cricket, they need their premier white-ball batter to do the same.

Under whom is the question here, even if Harry Brook, the vice-captain who led the team against Australia last summer, appears the likeliest choice. McCullum said he would take “a couple of weeks” to decide but, with the schedule starting to ease, the New Zealander believes that being a multi-format player, as Brook is, should be no impediment.

Things had started so brightly for Buttler too. After serving his apprenticeship as Eoin Morgan’s deputy during England’s thunderous four-year charge to World Cup glory in 2019, he took the role full-time in 2022. Later that year, alongside a new head coach in Matthew Mott, Buttler lifted the T20 World Cup in Australia. Even with a suspicion that all this was built on the foundations laid by Morgan, the good times appeared set to roll on.

English cricket has a history of struggling to win on all fronts, however. Once the Test side led by Ben Stokes and McCullum took over as the priority, the bilateral white-ball series morphed into proving grounds as the big names rested. England then tried to throw much of the old band back together for the World Cup defence in India, hoping the same music would flow. Instead, what they got was a succession of bum notes.

The nadir came against South Africa when, already reeling in the group stage, Buttler ignored the rising mercury of the heatwave in Mumbai and stuck his opponents in. What followed summed up a dismal campaign as a whole, Heinrich Klaasen delivering the kind of brain-boiling century that was suddenly beyond England’s fading world champions.

Rob Key, the team director who initially hired Mott as a light touch foil for the all-powerful Morgan, offered the pair a second chance at last year’s T20 World Cup. The journey to a semi-final defeat at the hands of India was unconvincing to say the least, Buttler increasingly tetchy in public, no team of note beaten, and the tactics baffling at times.

Out went Mott, Key expanding McCullum’s brief in the hope it would defibrillate results, as occurred with the Test team. Instead, nine defeats from 10 has brought his methods into question almost immediately. Little wonder, having briefly thought about dissuading Buttler the captain, McCullum found the idea of resuscitating the batter more appealing."
RFL warns clubs that planned coup will financially cripple the sport,['Aaron Bower'],2025-02-28,"The Rugby Football League has warned clubs that an attempt to sideline the sport’s ­governing body and replace its chair could have ­“catastrophic financial ­consequences” after taking legal advice to stave off a planned revolt.

Rugby league’s professional clubs will assemble in March to ­consider a proposal put forward by the Super League club Leigh ­Leopards and Championship side Batley ­Bulldogs, which calls for the immediate removal of Simon Johnson, after a purported loss of confidence in the direction of the governing body.

They also want to lead a drive to appoint a new external ­implementation committee that would review the governance of the sport, with the clubs rather than the RFL board of directors selecting who sits on the committee. The intention of the dissenting clubs is to bring back Johnson’s predecessor Nigel Wood as chair of that panel and as the interim chair of the governing body – despite him being paid a severance package of £300,000 to leave the same role in 2018.

Wood is now the chairman of the Championship club Bradford Bulls and, in documents sent to clubs this week that have been seen by the Guardian, the RFL has responded strongly. It has sought legal advice from leading international law firm Pinsents, and insists any such move to bring back Wood would fall foul of its own constitution, as well as Sport England’s Code for Sports Governance.

The RFL told clubs that the ­appointment of Wood or any ­individual ­currently in position at a competing club would amount to “multiple breaches” of the ­sport’s governance requirements and could lead to severe financial ramifications. They also allegeIt also claims that any attempt to appoint Wood would be “impossible” under the sport’s Articles of Association and such a move would immediately be revoked.

But perhaps most tellingly, clubs were warned that, if such a move ­succeeded, it would lead to major financial implications for a sport already wrestling with a ­changing monetary landscape. Failure to adhere to Sport England’s code, according to the RFL, could put at risk the £3.4m funding rugby league currently receives every year, with talks ongoing on ­securing more funding over the next 12 months.

And the RFL also stressed that it would potentially compromise the terms of a long-term loan a­rrangement with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport secured during the pandemic. The sport currently owes around £4.5m and if that money was liable to be repaid immediately, coupled with the loss of Sport England funding, it would result in a black hole of more than £7m, it claimed.

The governing body told clubs: “This will potentially have ­catastrophic financial ­consequences for the RFL, its members and ­stakeholders.” It subsequently described the ­proposals as “unlawful” and ­“unreasonable” in the view of its legal counsel, and said it is under no obligation to put the planned ­proposals forward before members.

Johnson’s immediate removal as chair is understood to have support, irrespective of whether or not the plans to bring back Wood succeed. A counter-proposal by the RFL suggesting Johnson will step down before the end of 2025 will be heard at the same meeting with the RFL agreeing to a strategic review of the sport: but only with the governing body’s input into the appointment of the relevant individuals.

However, the clubs driving the ­proposals – led by Leigh’s Derek ­Beaumont and Leeds’s Gary ­Hetherington – want to be solely responsible for appointing any ­committee tasked with ­reviewing rugby league’s ­governance. ­Beaumont, in further emails seen by the Guardian, wrote to clubs on ­Thursday insisting the RFL was ­“trying to alarm” members by warning of grave financial consequences.

In a statement, the RFL said it had shared supporting papers for its spring council meeting according to process, adding: “New papers include an explanation, from the RFL Board, of the submission of a board resolution to be considered before the four member resolutions, following legal advice on the potential impact of the member resolutions.

“This paper explains why the board has submitted its own resolutions, which aim to demonstrate that the Board has listened to the concerns of blubs and is willing to enable discussion of changes, provided it is in accordance with good governance and ensures smooth and stable leadership.

“The Board and Executive must always remain fully focused on strong governance and the future health of the sport and will continue to listen to and engage with members and stakeholders.”

Leigh Leopards, Batley Bulldogs and Leeds Rhinos have been approached for comment."
Grassroots clubs hold key as Norway prepares for historic vote to scrap VAR,['Nick Ames'],2025-02-28,"Skoppum IL have never pretended to be what they are not. The club represent a pretty village an hour’s drive south of Oslo, fielding teams from the under-14 age group down. Their goals are modest but of the kind that nourish an entire sport: to provide a safe and welcoming environment in which the community’s youngsters can play. There are hurdles to overcome, such as a need for up-to-date artificial pitches and the challenge of increasing participation among girls.

On Saturday afternoon, though, Skoppum and Norway’s 1,700 grassroots clubs will be asked to make a decision that could cause shockwaves far beyond their country. They will gather online or at Oslo’s Ullevaal Stadion for the Norwegian Football Federation’s (NFF) annual general assembly and are entitled to vote on whether video assistant referees are scrapped in the highest division, Eliteserien. It will conclude a saga that has ripped at the domestic game’s fabric. The top two tiers have voted for the technology to be discontinued but, in the final stage of an outwardly democratic process that many believe has been the opposite, the clubs whose lives it barely touches are in effect tasked with the final say.

“It surprises us that we’re being dragged into this,” the Skoppum chairman, Kenneth Laumb, says. “It’s something that only affects the top clubs in Norway. We appreciate that there’s a democracy in Norwegian football where clubs, even of our size, can help decide big issues but this isn’t one that we feel we should have been involved in. It feels like we’re being used as pawns in a power game.”

Last month Norway’s top 32 clubs recommended, by a margin of 19 to 13, that VAR be scrapped. Each had held a meeting of its members to decide how to vote. The expectation was that the NFF, which had encouraged a vote after extensive protests inside stadiums and promised to give weight to its outcome, would mirror that recommendation but instead it proposed the technology be retained.

The thoughts of clubs further down the pyramid will decide everything. Such is the level of discontent that, whereas grassroots outfits tend to side with the NFF’s proposals and as few as 10% traditionally turn up to the general assembly, all bets are off this time. Many local sides may mirror the stance of their nearest top-flight club, and Skoppum are far from the only ones disgruntled at being hauled in to the sharp end of an impassioned debate.

“We feel our involvement is pointless,” says Jørgen Grydeland, general manager of the suburban Oslo club Oppsal IF. “It did not require a democratic decision from the grassroots clubs when VAR was introduced. This was decided through a Teams meeting with the top clubs. If VAR had been introduced through a democratic process with grassroots clubs back then, it would have felt more natural to decide VAR’s future fate in 2025.

“This is no longer about VAR itself; it’s about trust in the NFF, how they undermine democratic processes and create a distance between themselves, grassroots clubs and their supporters.”

There is a sense the NFF and its president, Lise Klaveness, widely feted as a progressive figure for much of her tenure, simply refuse to lose the argument. They are hugely reluctant to diverge from a continent in which, with Sweden a notable exception, VAR has become a highly controversial staple. “It feels like the NFF has kept moving the goalposts whenever they see they’re losing the battle over VAR,” Laumb says.

This week a pro-VAR interview with Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the Fifa referees’ committee, appeared on the website of domestic television rights holder TV2. It had been organised by the NFF. In advance of Saturday’s vote, leaders of the federation’s 18 district associations came out in favour of its continuation. They had seemingly been whipped into line.

Many feel that the NFF, having invited the VAR debate, has sullied it. “Trust in them is now broken into pieces,” says Ole Kristian Sandvik, spokesperson for the influential Norsk Supporterallianse. “That’s sad because Lise is doing a lot of good things on the international stage, but right now it’s pure chaos on home turf. A lot of supporters believe they were lied to, that this has all been just for show and not a real process, and that everything was decided ahead of it.”

Using the hashtag #BreddenMotVAR [grassroots against VAR], a number of grassroots clubs have been cohering their rebellion online. The hope is that it energises those who would not ordinarily engage with the vote. Skoppum have held a board meeting and confirmed that they want VAR to be discontinued. A similar process has driven Oppsal’s decision. “What I can say is that we will not vote for VAR,” Grydeland says. There are more relevant matters at play for Oppsal, who have more than 100 teams at various levels: they have tabled a proposal that involves removing transfer fees for youth and amateur players.

Laumb and Grydeland fear a majority will land in favour of keeping VAR, although many other voices around Norwegian football believe the issue is delicately poised. Perhaps Norway will break ranks and, to the disquiet of governing bodies elsewhere, stoke appetites for other countries to follow suit.

“Ignoring the majority now risks pushing more people away from the sport,” Laumb says. “We believe football is about joy, community and fairness, not technology that overcomplicates the game and silences the roar of the crowd. Let’s give the sport back to those who live for it.”

The NFF was approached for comment."
"Favour And Fortune can take leg one in £100,000 Cheltenham festival bonus",['Greg Wood'],2025-02-28,"The £100,000 bonus on offer if the winner of Morebattle Hurdle at Kelso can follow up in any race at the Cheltenham festival has turned what is already the richest handicap hurdle in Scotland into one of the most interesting and competitive events in the immediate run-up to National Hunt’s showpiece meeting, and several of the sharpest trainers in the business have runners towards the head of the market for Saturday’s renewal.

Foremost among those is Emmet Mullins, who announced himself as one of the shrewdest handlers around – and well in advance of his Grand National success with Noble Yeats in 2022 – when The Shunter took the Morebattle in 2021 and then followed up in the Plate, one of the festival’s most competitive handicap chases, less than a fortnight later.

Mullins relies this year on the mare Vischio, who joined the yard after winning a competitive race at Punchestown in November and followed up on her first start for her new trainer in a stronger race at the Dublin racing festival.

She showed an abrupt turn of foot to go five lengths clear at Leopardstown and given her trainer’s well-earned reputation for priming a handicapper, it is no surprise to see her installed as the favourite in the early betting, not least as Mullins has gone to the trouble of entering her in three handicap hurdles at the festival.

Her last two runs were off 111 and 119, however, and Vischio is a stone higher in the ratings on Saturday. She might yet prove to be thrown in even off 133, but this is an intensely competitive heat and there is little value in a price of around 5-1.

Tellherthename and Alnilam have similar profiles at better odds but both are potential front-runners in a field packed with pace and Alan King’s Favour And Fortune (3.30), who is entered in the County Hurdle at Cheltenham, could be the one to benefit if the leaders go off too fast.

He ran an eye-catching race to finish fourth in Newbury’s ultra-competitive William Hill Hurdle last time, will race off the same mark on Saturday and had enough class to finish sixth in last year’s Supreme Novice Hurdle.

Kelso 1.10: A wind op since his chase debut could make the difference for Kidman, who travelled like the best horse last time but faded in the closing stages.

Newbury 1.20: Quick Wave has gone well fresh in the past and is an interesting debutant in veterans’ events returning from another extended break.

Kelso 1.45: Dan Skelton’s Grey Dawning is the percentage call over Iroko, a leading Grand National contender, to bounce back from a disappointing showing in the King George at Kempton on Boxing Day.

Doncaster 2.05: Grade One company was a step too far for World Of Fortunes at Leopardstown last time but she will be tough to beat dropping back to Listed level.

Kelso 2.20: Young Jack goes well at this track, William Maggs is well worth his 5lb claim and early offers of around 20-1 are worth an each-way interest.

Crystal Palace sack promotion-winning head coach Laura Kaminski,['Tom Garry'],2025-02-28,"Crystal Palace’s chairman, Steve Parish, described the decision to sack Laura Kaminski as “extremely difficult” after the Women’s Super League’s bottom side confirmed the head coach’s shock departure.

Kaminski guided Palace to promotion by winning last season’s Championship title but the club have made a change after 14 games of the 22-match top-flight campaign, with the team four points from the last safe spot.

The news was announced less than 48 hours before Sunday’s home WSL fixture against Liverpool, who are also managerless after the exit of Matt Beard on Thursday. Palace are through to the Women’s FA Cup quarter-finals, in which they travel to Chelsea on 9 March.

In their inaugural WSL season the London club have won one game and drawn three but there had been a widespread feeling externally that the side had performed well in attempting to bridge the gap between the second and top tiers.

Last term Bristol City were relegated straight back to the Championship with six points, a tally Palace equalled by drawing at Brighton on 2 February in their most recent WSL match. But they have not won in the league since 6 October and remain the favourites to be relegated.

Parish said: “This has been an extremely difficult decision for the club to take. Laura has made a fantastic impact since arriving in the summer of 2023, getting the club promoted to the WSL for the first time in its history. Laura has given her all, on and off the pitch, and she leaves here with all of our thanks and best wishes for the future.”

Kaminski’s exit follows WSL manager changes this season at Arsenal, Aston Villa and Liverpool. The Liverpool interim manager, Amber Whiteley, has said she will put her name forward to become their full-time manager. The former Liverpool academy coach, who was Beard’s assistant, said: “I’ll put my name in the hat.”

As revealed by the Guardian, it is likely she will be in interim charge for the rest of this season. “That’s the indication I’ve been given,” Whiteley said, “but obviously that recruitment process has already started.

“There are always mixed emotions when a manager leaves a club – it’s never an easy thing to go through. But the players have been absolutely brilliant today, the way they’ve responded and turned their focus to Palace at the weekend. They were super in training.”

Remi Allen has been sacked as manager of Southampton after only seven and a half months. The club sit eighth in the Championship, a comfortable 15 points above the relegation zone but 12 points below the leaders, Birmingham City.

Allen oversaw four wins, five draws and five defeats from her 14 league fixtures and a memorable 4-0 win at local rivals Portsmouth in the League Cup group stage. Southampton do not have a fixture this weekend."
Farewell Eurosport: home of lesser-spotted sports ends for UK fans with minimal fanfare,['Nick Ames'],2025-02-28,"After a scenic ride through the winding lanes between Marín and A Estrada, a 36-year journey reached its close. The last winner ever to grace British and Irish Eurosport was Magnus Cort, whose dominant second stage victory in O Gran Camiño was enough to leave fans wanting plenty more. “Another great moment,” acclaimed the commentary, but it would be the final one on a channel that had become cycling’s home.

Eurosport’s farewell at around 2am on Friday came with little fanfare. Cort’s victory blended into a recurring advert promoting the integration into TNT Sports and the Discovery+ streaming platform, where the pick of its offerings will now reside. “Eurosport channels in the UK and Ireland have now closed,” advised a voice above reels of skiers, cyclists, rugby players, footballers and motocross riders. “The sports you love have moved to TNT Sports”.

On Friday morning, anyone reflexively looking for Sky channel 417 would be floundering at the remote control. Not even the ghost of Eurosport 1’s former residence was permitted to linger: the gap between 416 and 418 was conspicuous for anyone addicted to an eclectic blend of fare that skirted the mainstream, transporting viewers far beyond the modern force-feeding of Premier League and Champions League stodge.

What do viewers stand to gain? The first hurdle for TNT, in luring Eurosport’s hardy faithful, may be financial. A monthly £6.99 fee becomes £30.99, with slightly cheaper deals available through provider packages. The latter amount allows a delve into TNT’s panoramic offering of premium events but feels alienating to those who, paying the lower price, may simply have been seeking particular sports that rarely see light of day elsewhere.

The concern is that those sports will suffer if fans vote with their wallets. A smorgasbord of expanded European club competition football may be little draw to those whose passion lay in a few precious hours of skiing each week. There is a sense that sports lovers with scant interest in football are being asked to pay for the stratospheric costs of its broadcast rights. Not for the first time, those with more niche concerns stand to see their lives complicated.

An example often cited by those worried about the impact of dwindling eyeballs is that of MotoGP, which aired on BBC before 2013 but had a slump in engagement behind the paywalls of TNT and its predecessor BT Sport. A move this year to broadcast some MotoGP coverage on Quest, the free-to-air channel that shows elements of TNT’s package, may redress that balance. That may point a viable direction for other sports in the post-Eurosport era, although in cycling’s case the only guarantee is for highlights packages from major events and a weekly magazine show.

Earlier this year Scott Young, who leads the European operation at Eurosport and TNT’s parent company WBD, claimed combining their resources would give viewers what they are looking for: “A slightly simpler journey on where to find the sport they love.” That is not entirely untrue in a landscape where British football supporters, in particular, would nowadays require at least five different subscriptions to receive every piece of output from Europe’s top leagues.

But fans of cycling, tennis, snooker and winter sports, to name a few, always knew Eurosport had their back. Simplicity will come at a cost and, for some smaller sports, it remains to be seen how deep TNT elects to go. Will typical Eurosport 2 offerings speedway, biathlon and cyclo-cross find a foothold in their stable?

Elsewhere in Europe, the channel will soldier on. Its viewing share in the UK was always low compared with the Netherlands, France, Germany and the Scandinavian countries in particular. Skiing, handball, basketball and volleyball are among major sports that draw in the numbers away from these shores but have rarely caught on widely to a British audience whose interests tend to be more focused.

It means there is a sense of genuine loss for anyone who basked in Eurosport’s softer edges and the thrill of accessing sports or competitions that once seemed beyond reach. As tastes homogenise and subscribers are implored to believe little matters more than big-ticket occasions and moments, its race as a stand-alone offering in the UK market had been run.

TNT is likely to judge the new packaging’s success in the number of sign-ups it receives for events such as the Tour de France, which will not be free to air on ITV from 2026, and next year’s Winter Olympics. Aficionados of those sports will pray that, for all their glossy new packaging, issues like cost and access do not nudge them out of view.

That is where Eurosport, now merely a synapse in the listings, now resides. It was a treat for anyone on a European holiday in the 1990s or 2000s, the joy of stumbling across a race or football match from the margins synonymous with the wonder of sampling new cultures. Now it returns to the role of continental curio; the hope must be that the sports TNT has assimilated do not suffer for being paraded into a brave new era."
Cop16 nature summit agrees deal at 11th hour but critics say it is not enough,['Phoebe Weston'],2025-02-28,"The task of halting nature loss by 2030 is slipping out of reach, ministers have warned, as countries from around the world came to a hard-won compromise on nature finance after marathon negotiations in Rome.

Delegates at the UN biodiversity conference – known as Cop16 – broke into applause after finally reaching a deal in the Eternal City following a night of tense and painstaking discussions. Cop16 president Susana Muhamad wept as she brought down the gavel on the agreement outlining a roadmap for nature finance. The agreement broke a deadlock at UN talks seen as a test for international cooperation in the face of geopolitical tensions.

Despite some wins, difficult questions were kicked down the road, including the creation of a new fund to distribute money, and significant issues including nature-destroying subsidies and cutting pollution have not progressed.

Scientists have long warned that action is urgent. A million of the world’s species are threatened with extinction, while unsustainable farming and consumption destroy forests, deplete soils and spread plastic pollution to even the most remote areas of the planet.

Key decisions were adopted in the final minutes of the last day of rebooted negotiations at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization headquarters in Rome.

Muhamad called it a “historic day”, and added: “We achieved the adoption of the first global plan to finance the conservation of life on Earth.”

A number of leaders called the agreement a victory for cooperation. “Our efforts show that multilateralism can present hope at a time of geopolitical uncertainty,” said Steven Guilbeault, Canada’s minister of environment and climate change.

Jean-Luc Crucke, Belgium’s climate and ecological transition minister, agreed. “Today we are in a world that is politically changing,” he said. “And not always in the right direction.”

He said that getting the agreement over the line proved that multilateralism was still working, and added: “So there is a great significance to these negotiations.”

Crucke described the Cop negotiations as the “least bad” process. If we really want to save nature, he said, “there is no other solution than this one”.

Q&A What is Cop16 and why is it reconvening? Show Every two years, representatives from around the world meet to discuss UN targets to halt nature loss by 2030. The gathering is formally known as the conference of the parties of the UN convention on biological diversity – shortened in this case to Cop16, as it is the 16th meeting. The last gathering was in Cali, Colombia, last November, but the meeting ended in chaos with key issues left unresolved. From 25 to 27 February in Rome, parties will gather for an additional meeting to finish those negotiations, and tackle the most divisive issue: money. The main topics being discussed include who will pay for conservation and how to distribute the money. Delegates are also set to agree on a monitoring framework, so countries can be held to account on their progress on meeting the biodiversity targets for this decade. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

The decision comes more than two years after a landmark deal to slow the rampant destruction of nature this decade and protect at least 30% of the world’s land and seas. That would protect ecosystems and wildlife that humans rely on for food, climate regulation and economic prosperity.

The meeting comes as countries face a range of challenges, from trade disputes and debt worries to the slashing of overseas aid – particularly by the Trump administration.

Washington, which has not signed up to the UN’s convention on biological diversity, did not send representatives to the meeting.

But others at the summit expressed frustration at the agreement’s lack of ambition when it comes to the environmental crisis. The negotiator from Bolivia, Juan Carlos Alurralde Tejada, raised concerns about the text “diluting” commitments to biodiversity and opening the path to an “indefinite discussion” on who will pay for conservation and how to distribute the money.

“Biodiversity cannot wait for a bureaucratic process that lasts for ever, while the environmental crisis continues to get worse,” Alurralde said. “Forests are burning, rivers are in agony and animals are disappearing.”

Meanwhile, the overarching ambition to halt nature loss by 2030 is looking more difficult to reach, with global wildlife populations having plunged by more than 70% between 1970 and 2020, according to the most recent assessment, with no sign of slowing.

“Honestly, it’s almost impossible when you see the trends of where things are going,” said Max Fontaine, environment and development minister in Madagascar, one of the most biodiverse countries. “We are not going in the right direction, we all need to strengthen efforts.”

Five years to implement the biodiversity targets was not enough, said the Liberian negotiator, Datuama Cammue, who believed the UN process had been too slow. “It will take a lot of financial input and expert input to get it done. With this type of spirit, I really don’t think that it’s possible.”

The failure to finalise an agreement in Cali was the first in a string of disappointing outcomes at environmental summits last year.

A climate finance deal at Cop29 in Azerbaijan in November was criticised by developing countries as woefully insufficient, while separate negotiations about desertification and plastic pollution stalled in December.

Countries had already agreed to deliver $200bn (£159bn) a year in finance for nature by 2030, including $30bn a year from wealthier countries to poorer ones.

As of 2022 (the latest year for which data is available and before the Cop15 deal was signed), wealthy countries that signed the agreement had provided $10.95bn in biodiversity funding, according to the report by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and Campaign for Nature.

Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, Norway’s climate and environment minister, said countries had a “big, big job ahead” to meet the 2030 finance goal. “We have to do everything we can to meet those targets,” he said, adding that it was important to be ambitious in climate and biodiversity targets. He said: “Ambitious is not the same as impossible.”

Thursday’s decision sets out two main strands of action in the coming years – finding the extra billions of dollars in funding for biodiversity; and deciding on the institutions that will deliver the money.

Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns at the Zoological Society of London, said the finance roadmap was a “key milestone” but stressed that money is needed urgently.

“With only five years left to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, securing the necessary funds to accomplish this mission is more essential than ever,” she said.

What has been agreed?

‘Agreeing to agree’ on a new fund

Many developing countries demanded a new bank account to distribute nature finance. They argue that the current fund – which sits within the Global Environment Facility (GEF) – is too burdensome to access and is controlled by wealthy nations. This was the subject of the most tense negotiations.

“Agreeing to agree is maybe not sexy,” said Bernadette Fischler Hooper, global advocacy lead at WWF, “but it is a big achievement.” She added: “We’re going to live to fight another day. That is exactly what that is about.”

Countries will agree what to do on the new fund in 2028. In the meantime, all options are on the table – it could be a new fund, or an existing fund that has been made more palatable.

Roadmap for producing cash

The headline figure agreed on by countries at Cop15 in 2022 was to generate $200bn a year in nature finance. Developed nations committed to delivering $20bn in international biodiversity finance by 2025 – a deadline that has not yet been met. Negotiators agreed a roadmap to raising the money, which includes looking for new forms of finance as well as a push for development banks to increase spending on biodiversity.

For the first time there will be an “international dialogue” between ministers of finance and environment (as happens within the UN climate framework) which will make sure that finance for biodiversity is not siloed within environmental ministries. Brian O’Donnell, director of Campaign for Nature, described it as a “highlight of this deal”.

Monitoring progress

Cop17 in 2026 will be about measuring how countries are doing relative to their targets. In Rome they signed off what indicators they will use to submit their national reports. “The monitoring framework will allow us to do the accountability process at the next Cop,” said Chandler.

Launch of Cali fund

The Cali fund is a way to distribute money from companies who benefit from nature’s genetics. The fund was launched with nothing pledged, but the UN said commitments were coming “very soon”. According to the agreement, companies that met two of three criteria – sales of more than $50m (£39m), profits of more than $5m, and $20m in total assets – would need to contribute 1% of profits or 0.1% of their revenue to the fund.

The deal is voluntary and governments will need to introduce the rules domestically for it to have teeth."
‘Ultimate bringers of life’: How one Cornwall farmer is using beavers to stop flooding,['Helena Horton'],2025-02-28,"Chris Jones, a beef farmer, is very proud of his beavers. “They are just extraordinary,” he says.

Since releasing a couple into an enclosure on his Cornwall farm in 2017, he says they have saved it from drought, prevented flooding in the nearby village, boosted the local economy and even improved oyster beds in Falmouth Bay.

The rodents, which were hunted to extinction in England hundreds of years ago for their fur and oil, were once a common feature of our rivers. They may soon be again, after the government announced on Friday it would approve the first wild beaver releases in England for hundreds of years.

Walking to the edge of Jones’s farm, you can feel the soil start to get damper. Lush blades of grass – perfect for his cattle – grow around fat splodges of frogspawn as pasture slowly gives way to wetland.

That, along with the half-munched willow branches strewn across the ground, is a sure sign you are entering the realm of the beaver.

Walk further on and you can hear the gentle trickling of the water moving through the series of dams built by the industrious rodents, and see glassy pools around lichen-covered trees. At the very top of the enclosure is a magnificent pond, featuring two beaver lodges. This furry couple clearly decided it needed two homes. “I’m not sure what the council tax situation is for them,” Jones jokes.

The beaver enclosure was once wet pasture and became a wildlife area with the pond – though before its rodent inhabitants moved in it was about a third of its current size. “I still bring the animals in to graze sometimes, particularly when it’s dry,” Jones said. “There is no conflict between livestock and beaver.”

The habitat is stunning, with wetland areas of various depths and rivulets of water flowing at different speeds. There are shallow areas lined with gravel which make perfect fish nurseries, and lush vegetation that will be humming with invertebrate life come spring. The birds clearly like it – as we walk past, woodcock stir from the bushes and fly off.

But Jones is not satisfied with this awe-inspiring habitat. He yearns to free his beavers. “This really is a postage stamp,” he sighs. “If we could let them out, we could have this landscape all the way down to the sea. The water companies and the Environment Agency should be all over it.”

This is because beavers operate a free water treatment facility. Our rivers are deluged with nitrates and other pollutants from human and animal waste. Researchers from the University of Cambridge studied Jones’s farm and found that the river fed from the beaver enclosure had 80% lower levels of nitrates compared to farther upstream.

Though farmers like Jones can have beavers in enclosures on their land, and there have been some illegally released in England, it has not – until now – been lawful to release them into the wild.

Jones has been on the farm all his life. Initially it was beef and dairy, and now he just rears beef cattle. The farm has always been organic, which he credits to his father’s old-fashioned prewar farming methods, before pesticides became prevalent. Since taking over the farm 20 years ago, Jones has moved from organic to grass-only – and begun rewilding in earnest.

“I’ve doubled the soil carbon since I started this rewilding thing,” he says proudly. “I don’t trim my hedges, and 60% of the farm is now agroforestry – cows grazing around trees. This leaves grass undisturbed which gives habitat for small mammals, like voles and mice. These in turn have brought birds of prey, which feed on them, to the farm. As a result I’ve seen barn owls come to the farm for the first time in my lifetime – 65 years.”

He says his farm is as economically productive as t was before he started bringing nature back “I am trying to be as productive as possible while seeing how far we can go with rewilding. We need to eat but we also need lots and lots of wildlife. I think we can achieve both these aims.”

Most farmers will tell you nature has disappeared from the countryside in recent decades. Jones has seen it on his land since childhood. “I’m very aware of the wildlife we have lost over the years, particularly bird species which have just gone, curlews and grey partridge, for example,” he says. “It’s bloody distressing. But this feels like bringing something back and making a small difference.”

Introducing beavers was a natural progression. Jones started researching what other farmers were doing and came across some writing by the UK’s leading beaver guru Derek Gow. “It sounded like getting beavers was a total no-brainer. It makes the river more interesting, increases biodiversity, is good for fish and it reduces flooding. It sounded like we could really turbocharge what we were already doing.”

So he got in touch with Gow and decided to build a beaver enclosure on his land with the help of Cornwall Wildlife Trust and some scientists at the University of Exeter. The beavers were released in 2017. “We released them on the Friday and by Sunday they’d already started damming,” Jones says.

The beavers have helped Jones a lot in recent years. In 2022, England was hit by a severe drought meaning the grass dried up and many farmers had to give winter feed to their livestock as there was nothing for them to graze. Jones did not have this problem. “We pumped water from the beaver pond, and in that bad drought we actually had more water in our pond than at any other time – the beavers built the dam up higher because they were able to work with the lighter flow of the stream.”

It’s not just Jones and other beaver fanatics who make this claim about the rodents’ ability to create anti-flood infrastructure; a recent report by the government body the Environment Agency into ways to prevent flooding recommended the release of beavers. They can save the government money, too – in the Czech Republic, a family of beavers recently built a dam themselves. This infrastructure was due to cost the government £1m – and the beavers did it for free.

Jones says more farmers need to get on board with beavers. “Some farmers really have their head in the sand. We really need to adapt to climate breakdown, and make our land more resilient. Storing water is part of that – we can’t keep carrying on like before.”

Gesturing to the margins of his field that have been flooded by the beavers, he said: “There are some farmers who would see this and have a heart attack. They would think I was nuts. But firstly, this is the land of least agricultural value, and secondly during a drought they would all be jealous as this is the best grazing in town.”

The idea of a farmer bringing beavers to the quiet countryside perturbed some neighbours and incensed others. But most have come around. Jones has calculated that 10,000 people have come to visit his beavers since 2017 – and they all need places to stay, and pubs to eat and drink in.

“We’ve brought business to the pub and the village. We aren’t making anyone millionaires, but there is definitely a gentle uptick in the economy,” Jones said. “Some people absolutely loathe my beavers, there are a few very serious dairy farmers who are enraged by them, as they take the occasional tree down. Also, to begin with our neighbour who runs a riding stables hated the beavers but then realised their clients were so overjoyed when they saw a beaver on their ride, that they realised beavers are actually good for business.”

Another benefit Jones’s beavers have brought to the local area is an alleviation of flooding. “Our beaver area holds a huge amount of water, and their leaky dams slow the flow and stop the village from flooding. In 2013, before we got the beavers, it flooded twice in two months. It really should only flood once a decade.” Poor river management – straightening watercourses so water drains off the land and sluices down into the village below – has exacerbated the problem.

Fans of Falmouth oysters should also thank Jones and his beavers. “Going into the enclosure you see just how much silt they have stored here,” Jones says. “That silt would normally have gone down the river into the oyster beds on Falmouth bay.”

They make Jones happy, too. “I go down to the enclosure by myself sometimes, it is a very nice thing to sit there in the evening and I’ve had some extraordinarily close encounters – the beavers get very curious when it’s just me and come straight up to me. It’s been very fulfilling.

“The first time I saw a beaver was when it was in a cage in the back of Derek Gow’s van, ready to be introduced on to my farm,” he reminisces. “It was just extraordinary.”

When they were released, Jones felt elated. “It just felt like the most incredibly positive thing to be doing.”

And the beavers made quick work of bringing nature back to his farm. “I had no idea how fast they’d work but we have had 11 or 12 bird records, we now have 11 species of bats, 17 of dragonflies, the fish have all increased in size. When you see it happen in front of your face, it is just extraordinary. They are the ultimate bringers of life.”

After this initial excitement, progress to return the beaver to Cornwall has been a lot slower than Jones hoped for. “We wanted to end up starting something that ends up with beavers across Cornwall. But it has taken longer than we thought because Defra has sat on it for so long.”

Jones isn’t stopping at beavers.

Weather tracker: six cyclones swirl simultaneously in southern hemisphere,[],2025-02-28,"An uncommon meteorological event unfolded on Tuesday when six named tropical cyclones were active simultaneously in the southern hemisphere, several in close proximity to one another.

Three developed in the south-west Pacific. Severe Tropical Cyclone Alfred formed on 20 February in the Coral Sea to the north-east of Australia, reaching an intensity equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on Thursday with sustained winds of 105mph (170km/h) and gusts at about 140mph.

Alfred is tracking south, moving roughly parallel to the Queensland coast, and warnings have been issued for strong winds and rough seas. Though Alfred is not expected to make landfall, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology is monitoring the cyclone as it remains uncertain how close it will pass by the coast.

Farther east in the south-west Pacific, there were two shorter-lived storms, Rae and Seru, which reached a maximum intensity equivalent to a category 2 hurricane. Tropical Cyclone Rae developed just north of Fiji on 22 February before travelling south across the island. Tropical Cyclone Seru formed on 24 February over the southernmost Solomon Islands, travelling southwards and passing to the east of Vanuatu and New Caledonia.

While Seru remained offshore, Rae caused significant damage to some Fijian islands, owing to a combination of flood waters from heavy rain, gusts of about 100mph, and huge waves.

Severe Tropical Cyclone Bianca, which formed in the Timor Sea to the north-west of Australia, was active between 18 and 27 February in the south-east Indian Ocean, during which time it travelled west before veering south, allowing it to curve around the continent without making landfall. This cyclone had a peak intensity equivalent to a category 3 hurricane.

And in the south-west Indian Ocean, two more cyclones are bracketing Madagascar, both of which developed on Monday. The category 3-equivalent Intense Tropical Cyclone Garance formed to the north-east of Madagascar and travelled south. After passing to the west of Mauritius, Garance will affect the French island of Réunion on Friday, with 120mph gusts and up to 600mm of rain.

Meanwhile, the category 1-equivalent Severe Tropical Storm Honde formed in the Mozambique channel and travelled south-east, where it is skirting the southern tip of Madagascar.

Though infrequent, it is far from unusual for this many named storms to exist concurrently. A far rarer occurrence is for this many to occur within a single ocean basin.

The Pacific Ocean has recorded six simultaneous named storms on just one occasion, in August 1974, while the Atlantic record is five, set in September 1971."
Weatherwatch: marine ‘hot spot’ could change makeup of British fish species,['Paul Brown'],2025-02-28,"UK waters, particularly the southern North Sea, are warming fast, making the North Atlantic one of the world’s marine “hot spots”. Scientists have been asked by the UK government to forecast what this means for British food supply and predict potentially dangerous tipping points that lie ahead.

While the UK already has milder winters because of warmer seas and heavier rain because of extra moisture in the atmosphere, this investigation is about what is happening under the waves. Already fishers are travelling ever further north to catch British favourites such as cod and haddock, and some salmon stocks face extinction.

Anchovy, bluefin tuna, sardines, squid and red mullet are already replacing these species and fishers need British consumers’ culinary tastes to change if they are to make a living marketing these new species.

But more dangerous changes may also be afoot. The increasing acidity of the seas caused by greater carbon dioxide absorption might kill some marine species and the melting Arctic ice has the potential to switch off vital currents such as the Gulf Stream.

These dramatic changes could cause the loss of one of the UK’s major food sources. This fear has led the government to fund this new research aimed at predicting when these dangerous climate tipping points might occur."
Online banking problems prompt MPs’ concern amid UK branch closures,"['Kalyeena Makortoff', 'Mabel Banfield-Nwachi']",2025-02-28,"Thousands of UK bank customers were struggling to access their accounts on Friday, prompting concerns among MPs as lenders continue to close branches in a wider push towards digital banking.

The IT failures meant customers of TSB, Nationwide, First Direct and Lloyds Banking Group – including its Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands – were struggling to log into online bank accounts or suffering from payment delays.

The issues were worsened for customers who were ready for payday, often scheduled on the last day of the month. Most services were restored by Friday afternoon.

It is the second month in a row that users have had to grapple with delays on crucial days for payments. At the end of January, an IT glitch left some Barclays customers locked out of their accounts for almost 24 hours on what was also HMRC’s deadline day for settling self-assessment tax returns.

MPs on the influential Treasury committee have demanded answers from banks and wrote to the chief executives of lenders including Lloyds, NatWest, Santander, Nationwide, Barclays and HSBC in early February. Executives were ordered to give details of the outages, how they affected customers, how their board responded, and how they planned to prevent future problems. The committee was due to publish lenders’ responses in the coming days.

However, Friday’s outages are understood to have raised further concerns among MPs. The Treasury committee is assessing its options and will consider next steps next week, a person close to the committee said.

The outages come amid a wider push towards digital banking by lenders who are facing growing competition from online-only lenders such as Monzo, Revolut and JP Morgan’s Chase.

Lenders who once dominated the high street have continued shutting branches, in a move they say is justified by dwindling use of in-person banking. It has led to thousands of closures, with the number of branches across the UK falling from roughly 10,565 in 2014 to 6,870 by 2024, according to British Banking Association and Office for National Statistics data.

But repeated IT failures have highlighted the importance of providing face-to-face and manual banking services, ensuring that neither lenders nor their customers are held hostage by tech glitches, IT meltdowns or cyber-attacks.

The regulator has tried to curb the prospect of banking deserts. As of last year, the Financial Conduct Authority requires banks to hold off from closing their sites until they can guarantee access to cash will not be affected. But that has resulted in banks pushing customers towards alternatives, including banking hubs or Post Offices that offer cash services.

Commenting on the latest outages, UK Finance defended its members, who it said worked hard to fix any IT problems affecting customers.

“All banks invest heavily in their systems and technology to ensure customers have easy access to banking services,” the banking industry lobby group said. “Where issues arise, they work extremely hard to rectify them quickly and to support their customers. Banks have been posting information on their websites and social media accounts to ensure they keep customers updated.”

But Reena Sewraz, the retail editor at the consumer group Which?, said users should keep track of how the outages affected them, in case they could claim compensation. “These latest IT issues could cause real headaches for thousands of customers – made worse because it’s payday for many of them.

“It’s crucial that all affected banks keep customers updated and move quickly to compensate for any losses that may result from today’s outages. Customers should keep evidence of impacted payments should they need to make a claim. If customers have missed important payments, they should contact the relevant company to ensure they waive any fees incurred.”"
Family of woman killed by man with psychosis criticise English prison and policing ‘lapses’,"['Jamie Grierson', 'Steven Morris']",2025-02-28,"The family of a woman killed by a man with psychosis have said she “paid with her life for lapses in the English prison and policing system” after a coroner said failures by prison and police authorities contributed to the killing.

In a damning verdict, the senior coroner for Dorset, Rachael Griffin, said Marta Elena Vento, 27, a Spanish national, was unlawfully killed by Stephen Cole in December 2020 while she was working as a receptionist at a Travelodge hotel in Bournemouth.

In the summer and autumn of 2020, Cole had been on remand in Winchester prison for indecent exposure. He attacked two fellow inmates and two staff members, one of whom needed hospital treatment.

He was assessed by prison psychiatrists, who judged he had psychosis or possible paranoid schizophrenia and was prescribed olanzapine, which stabilised him. The healthcare services were run at the prison by a private health provider, Practice Plus Group (PPG).

Cole was unexpectedly released on 27 October 2020 with only a month’s worth of the medication. After it ran out, he attacked two people at the accommodation where he was staying and was placed in the Travelodge where Vento worked by his family after he was evicted from another hotel where he had been placed by the housing authority.

On 9 December, Cole punched, kicked and attacked Vento with hair clippers. The attack lasted for 42 minutes, in which Vento sustained 55 injuries. She later died.

Recording a narrative verdict on Friday, Griffin said: “Marta Elena Vento was unlawfully killed by another who, at the time of her death, was unmedicated for a diagnosed mental health illness because of a failure to sufficiently plan and ensure the continuity of his mental healthcare upon his release from prison six weeks prior to Martha’s death, and because he was not adequately managed as a sex offender in line with national guidance on his release from prison.”

After the hearing, Vento’s family issued a statement. “Today’s conclusion confirms what we have suspected in the four long years since our dear Marta was torn from our lives,” it said.

“It is overwhelmingly hard for us to understand how the English prison health system could allow someone like Stephen Cole, who was so clearly unwell, to be released without a care plan and the ongoing medication he needed.

“It is equally hard for us to understand why the English police did not make themselves fully aware of the danger Cole posed when he stayed at the Travelodge on that night.

“Our daughter paid with her life for lapses in the English prison and policing systems. The cost to our family can never be measured. Without our Marta, our lives will never be the same.”

In her concluding remarks, the coroner said that a discharge summary was not sent to Cole’s GP upon his release from prison, nor was there a referral to the mental health team to continue his care.

“At this time, there was no integrated mental health policy in place within the healthcare department of the prison,” she said.

“There was a lack of comprehensive care planning infrastructure across prison healthcare nationally and the prison healthcare team were experiencing pressures arising from reduced staffing following the mobilisation of the healthcare contract at the prison and the impact of the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic.”

Griffin said Cole was given medication upon release from prison, but there was no “continuity of the mental health care” and it soon ran out, leading to a relapse of psychosis.

Dorset police’s team dealing with violent and sexual offenders was responsible for managing Cole in the community, the inquest heard.

Griffin recorded that there was “incomplete information gathering to identify, assess and manage his risks in the community, and no Armss [at-risk mental state service] risk assessment was completed or management plan put into place in respect to the perpetrator prior to Marta’s death”.

The inquest previously heard that just before the attack, Cole told a police offender manager he was being spied on through the smoke alarms at the Travelodge and people were knocking on his window, though he was on the fourth floor.

Also, shortly before, Cole’s family arranged for him to see a GP to try to get more olanzapine but the doctor said he was not able to without details from those who had prescribed it.

In 2021 Cole pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility due to a psychotic episode and was given an indefinite hospital order."
UK weather: warmer conditions expected after chilly weekend,['Olivia Lee'],2025-02-28,"The UK can expect brighter skies and warmer weather next week, with some areas reaching 14C (57.2F), but not before a chilly weekend, when temperatures are expected to drop as low as -2C across the UK.

Early rising dog walkers and joggers across the UK may find themselves caught in freezing fog on Saturday morning according to Met Office meteorologist Honor Criswick. Yet the drier and milder conditions of the weekend will give way to sunshine and lots of bright weather next week.

Creswick said the beginning of March would be “actually more lamb-like than lion-like”. The proverb “in like a lion, out like a lamb” is a reference to the tendency for March to shift from cold, wet weather at the beginning of the month to warmer conditions by the end.

In London, temperatures are expected to reach 14C next Wednesday, replacing the grey skies of February.

Spells of rain and strong winds are expected to hit the UK during the middle of March, but dry and bright conditions could develop again later in the month.

Alex Deakin, a meteorologist for the Met Office, said that the UK has experienced a “duller than average winter”. He said: “It’s getting warmer, it’s feeling warmer already” and that most of the country could expect to see clear skies on Friday evening.

This means that good conditions are expected for the planetary parade on Friday evening – a rare alignment of seven planets that will be visible simultaneously between sunset and 6.30pm for the last time until 2040.

Deakin said: “You’ll need a really good view of the horizon [to see some of the planets]. Tonight is being called the peak but even for the next few nights, you’ll be able to see them.”

Clouds are forecast in the Lake District, central Scotland and Northern Ireland on Saturday – which is the first day of meteorological spring – and possibly some rain, but most areas can expect a fair, dry and sunny weekend.

The Met Office has described temperatures for this time of year as “bang-on average”, despite unusually frosty nights over the last few days."
British pharma company GSK pauses diversity work citing Trump orders,['Jasper Jolly'],2025-02-28,"The British pharma company GSK has paused diversity activities for UK workers, claiming that it is obliged to do so in response to executive orders by the US president, Donald Trump.

The FTSE 100 company has also scrubbed references to “diversity” from its website. GSK is led by Emma Walmsley, one of the few women to head a FTSE 100 company.

Donald Trump took aim at efforts to increase the representation of minorities in workplaces soon after starting his second term in the White House. His executive orders tried to ban federal agencies and contractors from having diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) targets.

The orders have faced challenges in US courts, but that has not stopped a procession of American companies, including Goldman Sachs, Walmart, McDonald’s, Ford, Amazon and the Facebook owner Meta from rushing to remove their own diversity policies. BlackRock, the world’s largest investor, on Friday joined the crowd, saying it would abandon targets of increased representation of minorities in its workforce.

However, the move by GSK, formerly known as GlaxoSmithKline, has acted despite being a British company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and headquartered in central London.

Internal communications said the company was obliged to comply with Trump’s executive orders because the US is the company’s largest market and the US government is its No 1 customer. GSK argued on Thursday that it could raise the potential pay package for Walmsley to nearly £22m in three years’ time in order to compete with US rivals.

The British company’s position on diversity contrasts with others. Notably, its British pharma rival AstraZeneca, which also employs thousands of workers in the US, has not made any changes to its diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

The GSK communications said that all diversity and inclusion policies were being reviewed. In the meantime, there is to be a pause on diversity and inclusion activities, although it is understood that efforts to promote diversity in clinical trials – vital to understand medicines’ effects across varied populations – will not be affected.

References to “diversity, equity and inclusion”, present as late as 19 February according to the Internet Archive, were changed to merely “inclusion” on one section of GSK’s website.

Mentoring groups for women have been put on hold, as has a social mobility programme in the UK that works with students from less-privileged socioeconomic groups to support them entering the workplace, according to sources. Charitable activities with a diversity element are also under review.

A GSK company spokesperson said: “We are strongly committed to GSK being an inclusive workplace where our people can be themselves, and have their different perspectives, experiences and characteristics valued, because this helps everyone perform at their best.

“We have to ensure we remain compliant with the law in the countries in which we operate, including the US. This is why we have paused some activities to review them. To be clear, this does not necessarily mean they will be stopped but we may need to make some changes. We are consulting and talking to our people about all of this.”

The changes have caused disquiet among some of GSK’s UK staff.

Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, a campaign group, said: “It’s seriously disappointing to learn of GSK taking this step. It’s likely to go down very poorly with many of GSK’s longest-standing investors, clients and stakeholders. Companies that abandon policies that promote equal opportunities will likely lose talent over time and fail to attract the best. It’s a shortsighted approach with significant risk.”

A GSK spokesperson added: “The company completely rejects this characterisation of our actions.”

Sarah Tahamtani, head of the employment practice at Clarion, a UK law firm, said: “I can’t imagine a situation where a UK employer would be bound by an executive order in the US.” However, she added that Trump’s orders may shift “the general mood” with regard to diversity and discrimination, which could affect how UK companies operate."
Transatlantic ticket sales lift British Airways and IAG to ever higher annual profits,['Gwyn Topham'],2025-02-28,"Booming transatlantic ticket sales have lifted British Airways and its parent group to ever higher annual profits.

International Airlines Group, led by BA, announced post-tax profits edging up to €2.73bn (£2.26bn) for 2024, with operating profits up by 22% on the previous bumper year to €4.3bn (£3.55bn), as passenger numbers continued to rebound from the Covid-era collapse.

The bulk of the operating profit was driven by the British flag-carrier for the Spain-based group that also contains Iberia, Vueling and Level, as well as Ireland’s Aer Lingus.

The performance was seen as vindication of measures including a £7bn “turnaround” investment in BA, including new lounges and better technology to counter a faltering reputation for service and repeated IT-related failures.

The chief executive of IAG, Luis Gallego, claimed the results reflected “the successful execution of our transformation programme”.

IAG also grew its capacity by 6% overall last year, including on the lucrative transatlantic market, with BA now the market leader on London-US routes and Iberia increasing its share of the Latin American market from Europe.

Gallego said: “We are focused on continuing to make our brands the first choice for customers, by growing our network and enhancing the customer proposition, while our disciplined capital allocation ensures we can continue to invest in the business, deliver strong financial results and create sustainable value for our shareholders.”

In a sign of IAG’s flushed financial success, he announced it would be paying a final dividend, taking the total dividend for the year to €435m (£359m), as well as embarking on a €1bn share buy-back scheme.

Shares rose about 4% on Friday afternoon, taking the price near a five-year high and more than double where IAG shares were trading a year ago.

Premium travel on the transatlantic routes remains a cash cow for BA, which contributed £2bn to IAG’s coffers, up from £1.3bn in 2023.

Sean Doyle, the BA chair, said capacity on the routes had “matured”, with available seats only likely to rise by 1%. “But we do see demand remains robust. And we also saw a very strong recovery in business travel onboard in the transatlantic in the second half of the year,” he said.

IAG’s results announcement still shows it does not believe business travel will return to pre-pandemic levels, particularly for short trips. However, affluent tourists are boosting its margins, and Doyle said BA was devoting ever more space to premium economy, with 15% more seats in the mid-range cabin than in 2019.

While analyst consensus is that IAG’s price will climb higher, some warned of the risks ahead with Donald Trump in the White House. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, a business recovery consultancy, said: “Despite current successes, IAG must remain wary of the potential headwinds of a volatile geopolitical climate, the possible impact of tariffs and a highly competitive travel market. There is some careful navigation to be done to capitalise on success and avoid unwanted turbulence in 2025.”

The group’s airlines carried 122 million passengers in 2024, up by 5.6%; 46 million of them were travelling on BA services.



Doyle said Gatwick’s second runway, which gained backing but not planning ratification from the UK government on Thursday, was likely to see BA build up its presence again at London’s second airport. But he ruled out restoring its operations there to pre-pandemic levels, after switching BA’s focus almost entirely to Heathrow in the crisis in 2020.

He said: “I think strategies tried before haven’t necessarily worked, but we have a big presence – both BA and IAG – at Gatwick, and have been growing our businesses there for the last three years. So we would evaluate the opportunity to grow when the capacity came on – but it wouldn’t be in the form of a second hub.”"
"Bank of England must proceed with caution over future rate cuts, says deputy governor",['Heather Stewart'],2025-02-28,"Bank of England policymakers must proceed cautiously – like mountaineers – as they cut interest rates in the months ahead as inflation risks rise, according to the central bank’s deputy governor, Dave Ramsden.

In a speech at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, Ramsden – a climber himself – returned to the mountain analogy previously used by the Bank’s chief economist, Huw Pill, to describe the path of interest rates.

Ramsden said: “A gradual and careful approach is always needed on the way down a mountain to ensure a safe descent and a successful outcome. But that doesn’t always mean the descent has to be slow.

“There may be circumstances when a slower-than-expected descent is justified but there will also be times when conditions require that the pace has to quicken.”

The Bank cut rates by a quarter point to 4.5% earlier this month and signalled that it expects to continue reducing borrowing costs, despite forecasting a “bump” in inflation in the coming months.

In an address that repeatedly stressed the heightened uncertainty facing policymakers, Ramsden said that inflation is now as likely to overshoot as to undershoot.

Ramsden backed a quarter-point interest rate cut in December, against the majority, fearing the jobs market was cooling rapidly and could lead inflation to undershoot.

But with the Bank now expecting inflation to rise to 3.7% later this year, and average weekly earnings growth to be 6.75% in the first quarter, much higher than previously forecast, he now believes the risks are balanced.

“Because of the evidence of recent months, I no longer think that risks to hitting the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium-term are to the downside. Instead, I think they are two sided,” he said.

He highlighted particular uncertainty about the outlook for the jobs market. Policymakers are concerned about the risks of a rapid downturn as the government’s increase in employer national insurance contributions takes effect in April – but are also worried about recent stronger-than-expected wage data.

Ramsden also pointed to the risks around trade policies, with Washington threatening tariffs on a slew of countries. “The UK is a relatively small open economy so these matter,” he said.

Markets are expecting the Bank to keep interest rates on hold at its next policy meeting on 20 March but have priced in two further cuts this year, taking the Bank rate down to 4%."
Culture secretary to hold urgent meeting with BBC chair over Gaza film,['Harriet Sherwood'],2025-02-28,"The culture secretary is to hold an urgent meeting on Friday with Samir Shah, the chair of the BBC, after the corporation apologised for “serious flaws” in the making of a documentary about the war in Gaza.

Lisa Nandy said she would be seeking assurances that a review commissioned by the BBC’s director general would be “comprehensive, rigorous and get to the bottom of exactly what has happened”.

The BBC has been engulfed in controversy since it was revealed that the 13-year-old narrator of the documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone, is the son of the deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas government in Gaza.

On Thursday, the BBC disclosed that a “limited” payment had been made to the boy’s mother by Hoyo Films, the independent production company that made the documentary.

Nandy said in a statement: “The public rightly holds the BBC to the highest standards of reporting and governance which is why I will be having an urgent meeting with the BBC chair later today.

“I want assurances that no stone will be left unturned by the fact-finding review now commissioned by the BBC’s director general. This review must be comprehensive, rigorous and get to the bottom of exactly what has happened in this case.

“It is critical for trust in the BBC that this review happens quickly, and that appropriate action is taken on its findings.”

After the BBC board met on Thursday to discuss the issue, the corporation said an internal review identified “serious flaws” in the making of the programme. “Some of these were made by the production company and some by the BBC; all of them are unacceptable … We apologise for this,” a spokesperson said.

They added: “The processes and execution of this programme fell short of our expectations. Although the programme was made by an independent production company, who were commissioned to deliver a fully compliant documentary, the BBC has ultimate editorial responsibility for this programme as broadcast.”

The BBC had asked Hoyo Films several times in writing about any potential connections Abdullah al-Yazouri, the film’s young narrator, and his family “might have with Hamas”.

Since transmission, Hoyo Films told the BBC that it knew Abdullah’s father was a Hamas minister but had failed to tell the corporation, the spokesperson said. “It was then the BBC’s own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.”

The BBC was seeking further information about the payment made to the boy’s mother.

In a separate statement, the BBC’s board said mistakes made in producing the documentary were “significant and damaging to the BBC”.

Stuart Andrew, the shadow culture minister, called for a “full independent” inquiry into the making of the documentary, and said police should become involved if any payments had been made to “Hamas or their affiliates”.

Andrew told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the “possibility of payments being made to Hamas or their affiliates is deeply troubling. That is why we believe there needs to be a full independent inquiry, so we can have absolute faith that everything is being looked at in the round, and make sure we know the processes that were followed or not followed, and exactly how much money has been potentially given to Hamas or its affiliates.”

If it emerged that “public money has got into the hands of Hamas or the official, that needs and warrants a proper criminal investigation”, he said. Hamas is designated a proscribed terrorist organisation by the UK government.

A former senior executive at the corporation said the BBC had made “basic rookie errors” over the documentary.

Roger Mosey, who was the head of BBC television news until 2013, said mistakes by the corporation were “not an unfortunate accident” but the upshot of “some people not doing their job properly and making sure this programme was fit to be broadcast”.

Speaking on the Today programme, Mosey said: “If you’re going to make a film about the most contentious issue in the world today, and where the BBC has to prove its impartiality, you have to get it right. The fact is that the BBC broadcast it, they took editorial responsibility, and then it has unravelled incredibly quickly.

“I think there are some basic rookie errors made here. It’s not an unfortunate accident. It’s actually that some people were not doing their job properly and making sure this programme was fit to be broadcast.”

Mosey rejected claims there was a “systematic bias against Israel” at the broadcaster. He said: “I don’t think the BBC is biased on the big issues of Israel and the Middle East. I think the BBC tries very hard on the most difficult of stories to get it right, and this so undermines it.”

The BBC said it had no plans to broadcast the documentary again or return it to iPlayer."
Cash Isa providers fail to offer savers benefits of more flexible rules,['Hilary Osborne'],2025-02-28,"Savers hoping to make the most of their Isa allowance as the end of the tax year approaches may be surprised to find that some providers haven’t adopted rule changes designed to make the tax-efficient accounts more flexible.

With the future of cash Isas reportedly under discussion at the Treasury, this year’s last-minute rush to invest before 5 April is under way, and providers are offering attractive interest rates to catch the eyes of savers.

The current tax year is the first in which you can open more than one of the same kind of Isa – a change that was announced in 2023’s autumn statement. Previously, your £20,000-a-year Isa allowance could be spread between different types, including a cash Isa or stocks and shares Isa, but since April 2024, the tax authorities have let you have any combination.

In theory this means that someone, for example, who has already during this tax year opened a fixed-rate cash Isa that they are no longer able to pay money into can now open another one with the same bank or building society and make the most of the best available rates that it is offering.

It is one of several moves designed to simplify the system, but in practice many providers will not accept an application for a second cash Isa.

Research from the financial data company Moneyfacts suggests that almost two-thirds of cash Isa providers do not allow customers to open a second account with them in the same tax year. This is the case at most of the UK’s biggest banks, including Santander, Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest and HSBC, and at several building societies offering some of the best rates on the market.

A saver attracted by the 4.22% two-year fixed cash Isa rate on offer this week at Coventry building society, for example, will find in the terms and conditions this rule: “You must not have paid in current tax year subscriptions to another cash Isa with us in the same tax year.”

Anna Bowes, a savings expert at the financial advisory firm The Private Office, says that while the rules on what you can do have changed, providers have not been obliged to adopt them.

When she looked at what was available, “what I found was that most providers would let you open an Isa with them if you had one with someone else, but most would not let you open a new one with them”.

She says that some providers were already offering what was called a flexible Isa, which allowed a similar thing ahead of the change.

Nationwide building society is one of the best-known providers to offer this kind of cash Isa to savers. It describes it as a “portfolio cash Isa”, in which you can hold different types of accounts opened at different times. A spokesperson says: “This means [a saver] could put some in, say, a fixed-rate Isa and leave some in an easy access Isa, or have two fixed-rate Isas with different terms, etc.”

At the time of writing, Nationwide was offering a one-year, fixed-rate Isa at 4.1%, and a two-year one paying 4%, plus a one-year triple access online Isa that you can make up to three withdrawals a year from before the interest rate is cut from 4% to 1.75%. You can take advantage of these rates even if you already hold money with the society, and spread your savings money across all three types of account.

The Moneyfacts research found that only 36 out of the 98 cash Isa providers it lists said they allowed multiple accounts in the same tax year. These include the online bank Zopa, which was offering a table-topping 5% on a one-year cash Isa at the start of the tax year, and this week appeared in the best-buy tables paying 4.4%. OakNorth Bank was offering a best-buy rate of 4.41% and will let you pay in even if you already have one of its cash Isas. Kent Reliance, M&S Bank and Skipton building society are among other providers that allow it.

Several banks, including Santander, indicated that they could review their position in the future.

However, if there is a question mark over the accounts in the future, there might not be an incentive for providers to make changes.

Another rule change designed to make paying into an Isa easier was the scrapping of the requirement to sign a declaration before moving money into a previous year’s account; but again, many providers have ignored this change.

Yorkshire building society’s website, for example, states that if you have a cash Isa from a previous tax year that you want to add to, “you’ll need to complete an Isa declaration form. We can’t add money to your account until we’ve received this.”

The good news is that the process is pretty straightforward and, whoever your account is with, it should just involve filling in a form online or in a branch.

Partial transfers on money saved or invested this year were also introduced, with the government website now stating: “You can transfer all or part of the savings in your individual savings account (Isa) from one provider to another at any time … The investment can have been made this year or in previous years.”

However, banks and building societies are typically refusing to take partial transfers of money invested in this tax year, and insisting that if you do want to switch, you have to move the whole lot.

A spokesperson for the Treasury says: “It is a commercial decision for individual Isa providers whether they take advantage of increased flexibility in the Isa system, and customers should compare the terms offered by providers to find a product that suits their needs.”"
Prisoners in England and Wales could earn early release under Texas-style shakeup,['Aletha Adu'],2025-02-28,"Prisoners may have to earn their freedom through “good behaviour credits” rather than be automatically released after a set period as part of an overhaul being considered by the government.

The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, who travelled to Texas where a similar scheme was introduced more than a decade ago, said she wanted a “carrot-and-stick” approach throughout the prison system in England and Wales.

In Texas, there is no automatic early release scheme. Instead, prisoners can reduce the length of time they serve by earning “good behaviour and good time” credits, which means they can serve as little as 25% of their sentence behind bars if they maintain good behaviour and work productively.

Automatic early release was introduced in England and Wales in 1991 for prisoners sentenced to less than four years, but expanded to more serious criminals in 2003. Now up to 70% of prisoners will be released automatically. If rolled out, prisoners could earn credits via work, training or taking part in any education scheme.

Mahmood told the Daily Telegraph: “We’ve got to be open to all potential future constructions of sentences. If you’re going to think about incentivised behaviour, obviously it’s a carrot and a stick, isn’t it? So you can’t then leave unchanged the rest of your current sentencing framework on automatic releases.

“If you’re going to go down the road of incentivisation, actually that might mean some things no longer become automatic. But we would have to consider carefully how you would take the best learning from the law and read across to our system because our arrangements are different. Although that’s the benefit of having a review, which means we can.”

David Gauke, the former Conservative justice secretary under Theresa May’s premiership, accompanied Mahmood on the Texas trip, during which they assessed how well good behaviour and intensive rehabilitation schemes had helped to reduce prison overcrowding.

Such changes in the US state have reduced the number of offenders recalled to jail to 16.6%, as national levels hover about 68%.

Gauke said incentivising people over time allowed a “more considered approach to assessing their behaviour”.

A large proportion of prisoners in England and Wales are released on licence after serving 40-60% of fixed-term sentences.

Last week, the Prison Reform Trust urged the government to consider abolishing the use of short, fixed-term recalls of 28 days or fewer, amid concerns that the rising numbers of people being recalled to prison was “trapping” them in the criminal justice system.

An independent sentencing review said longer jail terms had been a “kneejerk” policy response to show action by successive governments.

According to the latest data from the Ministry of Justice, the number of prisoners in England and Wales reached 86,941, the highest since 21 October last year, which was the day before the government released more than 1,000 prisoners as part of its urgent measures to ease the overcrowding crisis."
Beaver releases into wild to be allowed in England for first time in centuries,['Helena Horton'],2025-02-28,"The release of beavers into English waterways is to be allowed for the first time in centuries, the Guardian can reveal.

The environment secretary, Steve Reed, is to announce that nature groups will be able to get a licence for the release. The first releases could happen this autumn.

Until about 20 years ago, the rodent had been extinct in Britain for 400 years, having been hunted for their fur, meat and scent oil. But in recent years, beavers have been returning to our waterways via licensed releases into enclosures and some illegal releases. There are estimated to be about 500 living in the wild in England.

Beavers create useful habitats for wildlife and reduce flooding by breaking up waterways, slowing water flow and creating still pools.

The government will set out a new approach that will allow beavers to live wild. Release projects will need to set out a 10-year plan to show where and how they would have an impact on the landscape.

It is understood there were hesitations in government over releasing the beavers, and Reed’s plan was stalled by No 10 because of concerns it was a Conservative legacy project that could needlessly upset farmers. After the Guardian reported this blocking of the policy, there was outcry from wildlife groups. Defra was in recent days given the green light for the announcement.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is understood to have made representations to Downing Street that beavers could be part of Labour’s growth mission, as the rodents work for free to build infrastructure and restore nature. The industrious animals recently saved the Czech government £1m by building a dam.

Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, welcomed the news. “Restoring nature means restoring whole ecosystems, and few can beat the beaver in helping bring landscapes to life,” he said.

“These much-loved animals can help restore rivers and wetlands and reduce flooding and drought. Their eco-engineering creates diverse habitats that are great for local communities and for wildlife. It’s high time for wild releases and excellent that the government is making progress.”

There are beaver plans ready to go. One such scheme is the National Trust’s Purbeck Heaths release project in Dorset, and the Wildlife Trusts organisation has sites in Devon and Cornwall where it wishes to release beavers.

This week, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, Tom Bradshaw, said farmers should be able to kill unruly beavers: “You’ve got to have the final control method in place. And if beavers end up in the wrong place, then that lethal control has to be part of being able to have that species reintroduced more widely.”

Current plans, published under the previous government, suggest such lethal control will be allowed as a last resort. The Guardian understands that plans to be published imminently will include support for farmers who have their fields inadvertently flooded by beavers. The aim is for the return of beavers to be carefully managed to avoid a negative impact on farming, food production and infrastructure.

This policy is almost a decade in the making. The former Tory environment secretary Michael Gove announced a beaver release trial in 2017. In 2020, the results of a trial of wild-living beavers on the River Otter in Devon found they reduced flooding in local settlements and the habitat they created increased biodiversity, as well as the size of local fish.

But lobbying from farming groups and landowners has made successive governments nervous to allow the signoff of a release plan.

Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative peer and former environment minister, had tried when in office to get governments to give the green light to beaver releases.

He said: “It’s great this is finally being resolved. It should never have taken so long. The beaver has a near-magical effect on the environment, retaining water, massively boosting biodiversity and bringing joy to our nature-loving public. Governments are always cautious but the case for beavers couldn’t be clearer.”"
Federal workers might get email requiring response after Trump and Musk praise efforts to investigate workforce – live,"['Lucy Campbell', 'Erum Salam', 'Jane Clinton']",2025-02-28,"From 2h ago 18.25 GMT Federal workers could get a second 'what did you do last week' email that may require a response This report is from the Associated Press. Federal employees could get another email on Saturday requiring them to explain their recent accomplishments, a renewed attempt by Donald Trump and Elon Musk to demand answers from the government workforce. Supporters showed solidarity with federal workers fired from USAid in DC on Thursday. Photograph: Probal Rashid/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/Shutterstock The plan, first reported by the Washington Post (paywall), was disclosed to AP by a person with knowledge of the situation who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The first email, which was distributed a week ago, asked employees “what did you do last week?” and prompted them to list five tasks that they completed. Musk, who empowered by Trump is aiming to downsize agencies and eliminate thousands of federal jobs, said anyone who didn’t respond would be fired. Many agencies, meanwhile, told their workforces not to respond or issued conflicting guidance. The second email will be delivered in a different way, according to the person with knowledge of the situation, potentially making it easier to discipline employees for noncompliance. Instead of being sent by the Office of Personnel Management, which functions as a human resources agency for the federal government but doesn’t have the power to hire or fire, the email will come from individual agencies that have direct oversight of career officials. It’s unclear how national security agencies will handle the second email. After the first one, they directed employees not to write back because much of the agencies’ work is sensitive or classified. Less than half of federal workers responded, according to the White House. The Office of Personnel Management ultimately told agency leaders shortly before the Monday deadline for responses that the request was optional, although it left the door open for similar demands going forward. On Wednesday, at Trump’s first cabinet meeting of his second term, Musk argued that his request was a “pulse check” to ensure that those working for the government have “a pulse and two neurons”. Both Musk and Trump have claimed that some workers are either dead or fictional, and the president has publicly backed Musk’s approach. Trump said that people who didn’t respond to the first email “ are on the bubble”, adding that he wasn’t “thrilled” about them not responding. “Now, maybe they don’t exist,” he claimed without providing evidence. “Maybe we’re paying people that don’t exist.” Share Updated at 18.29 GMT

12m ago 20.37 GMT Trump sued by Democrats for seeking control over federal election commission This report is from Reuters. Donald Trump was sued on Friday by the Democratic Party over a recent executive order it says violates federal election law by giving him too much power over the independent federal election commission. The lawsuit filed in the Washington DC federal court by three national Democratic committees is the party’s first against Trump during his second term. It comes as Democrats, outnumbered in Congress, seek an effective means to counteract far-reaching changes from Trump’s first six weeks in office, including many steps to lessen government oversight and eliminate internal dissent. Several dozen lawsuits have challenged other actions taken by Trump since his inauguration last month. Friday’s lawsuit objects to a February 18 order giving the White House more control over the election commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other traditionally independent agencies that normally operate day-to-day at arm’s length from the president. Other defendants include attorney general Pam Bondi, the election commission and three commissioners. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the election commission said that agency does not discuss litigation. Trump’s order, “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies,” makes his and Bondi’s opinions on questions of law “controlling” for all federal employees performing their official duties, and bans executive branch employees from advancing contrary views. Critics have called the order an unprecedented power grab. The Democrats said it would effectively substitute Trump’s views on election-related disputes for those of the bipartisan election commission, and let him dictate outcomes. According to the complaint, letting Trump micromanage the commission would undermine that purpose, by allowing a “single partisan political figure” to rig campaign rules and resolve disputes against his opponents. The plaintiffs include the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. They said Trump’s order is already causing irreparable harm, by making it harder for the Senate committee to defend against a complaint by the 2024 reelection campaign of Republican US Senator Ted Cruz of Texas over his opponent’s advertisements. The lawsuit seeks a declaration that a federal law shielding the election commission from “presidential coercion and control” is constitutional, and to block Trump’s February 18 order.

23m ago 20.26 GMT Faisal Ali US defence secretary Pete Hegseth has confirmed a report by CBS that the Trump administration has moved to ease restrictions on American commanders carrying out raids and ordering airstrikes outside battlefields. CBS reported that Hegseth changed the rules of engagement for the US army during a meeting with members of the US Africa Command (Africom) last month. In a post on social media above a hyperlink to the story, Hegseth wrote: “Correct.” The change gives greater latitude to American commanders to choose their targets and move against them. Biden initially tightened restrictions around airstrikes outside traditional conflict zone in 2022 after Trump loosened them. Under Biden’s guidance the president would have had to approve the drone strike himself, whereas Trump has moved decision making power further down the chain of command. Trump ordered his first airstrikes against IS-Somalia targets earlier this month. Share Updated at 20.40 GMT

32m ago 20.16 GMT State department terminates USAid initiative helping restore Ukraine's energy grid The state department this week terminated a USAid initiative that has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to help restore Ukraine’s energy grid from attacks by the Russian military, two USAid officials working on the agency’s Ukraine mission have told NBC News. According to NBC’s report, power outages have been applied overnight in some regions of Ukraine due to the attacks on energy facilities. Ukraine’s systems have been systematically targeted by Russia since its full-scale invasion three years ago. “It significantly undercuts this administration’s abilities to negotiate on the ceasefire, and it’d signal to Russia that we don’t care about Ukraine or our past investments,” one USAid official involved in the Ukraine mission said. The official continued: Russia is fighting a two-pronged war in Ukraine: A military one but also an economic one. They’re trying to crush the economy, but USAid has played a central role in helping it be resilient, [including] shoring up the energy grid … We’ve provided vast amount of support to the Ukrainian government to avoid a macro economic crisis. In addition to ending the Ukraine Energy Security Project, USAid is also dramatically downsizing its presence in Ukraine. Before the Trump administration’s latest moves, 64 American government employees and contractors were serving on the ground in Ukraine for the agency. Just eight of those personnel are slated to remain on the ground in the war-torn country after the Trump administration placed its remaining global workforce on administrative leave and ordered those workers not deemed “critical” to return to the US. The two officials warned that USAid withdrawing from Ukraine would leave its energy grid vulnerable in the heart of the winter as it endures assaults from further Russian missiles.

Trump cuts reach FDA workers focused on food safety and medical devices Read more In three letters sent on Wednesday, one each for the CDC, the FDA, and the NIH, energy and commerce committee senior Democrat Frank Pallone Jr, and the top Democrat on the health subcommittee, Diana DeGette, pressed Kennedy to disclose not only how many workers were terminated at each agency, but also how many more layoffs are expected. They also asked how many of the currently vacant positions would be left unfilled and how many of those fired were responsible for responding to outbreaks of diseases like bird flu, measles, and mpox. Kennedy had pledged “radical transparency” and accountability including an “unprecedented level of collaboration” with Congress during his confirmation hearings. HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Kennedy intended to provide the information. Pallone and DeGette also asked whether HHS conducted any assessment of how these firings would impact the country’s ability to respond to public health threats. They wrote: We are deeply concerned these widespread terminations took place without any review of these employees’ work history or without any analysis of the impacts these job losses would have on the Department’s ability to protect the health and well-being of the American people. The letters come just a day after a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration’s directives, which led to the mass firings, were illegal and ordered them to be rescinded. Pallone and DeGette warned that failing to restore these positions could put Americans at greater risk from foodborne illnesses, infectious disease outbreaks, and delays in medical research. The impending impact of these terminations, including exposing Americans to greater death and illness due to outbreaks of foodborne illness and infectious disease, will fall on your shoulders.

High heels and risky selfies: Etna eruptions cause despair among mountain rescuers,['Lorenzo Tondo'],2025-02-28,"A river of fire from the depths of the Earth carves its way through the black rocks of a mountain blanketed white with snow. Above, the setting sun tints the clouds red. Fountains of lava that explode from a crater soar hundreds of metres into the air and Etna’s roar echoes across the Sicilian sky.

Its recent eruptions were a breathtaking spectacle, drawing thousands of tourists and unwary daytrippers – many there for a selfie. For some, the outcome was catastrophic.

Dozens of people, lacking appropriate mountain gear, went missing last week and were recovered late at night suffering from hypothermia. Many sustained various injuries as hundreds of cars, haphazardly parked along the road leading to the lava flows, blocked the streets and prevented rescue services from reaching those in need of assistance. Authorities threatened to report imprudent visitors to the police and introduced restrictions to stay away from the magma.

“They have turned a volcano into a playground,” said Luca Ferlito, commander of the operational unit of Sicily’s Guardia Forestale. “After images of the eruption started circulating on social media, showing people skiing just a few metres from the lava flow moving over the snow, thousands of visitors stormed the mountain. Many of them were completely unequipped.”

Ferlito added: “We saw all sorts of scenes. People approaching the lava flow in high heels and miniskirts, people in shorts, someone started roasting sausages, others were taking shirtless photos near the lava. A couple brought a six-month-old baby; an American man showed up in jeans, a T-shirt, and crutches. We stopped a 70-year-old tourist who was wearing cotton trousers and summer rubber shoes.”

The Guardian joined rescue services on Mount Etna who had been brought in to assist residents and curb the flow of tourists and daytrippers from Sicily and beyond, even after mayors of the towns on the volcano’s slopes ordered visitors to stay at least 500 metres from the lava.

“The presence of so many people forced us to work non-stop, day and night without rest,” says Paolo Bernardini, commander of the Alpine Rescue Unit of the Guardia di Finanza. “Since the lava flows started descending to lower altitudes, the number of rescue operations has increased exponentially.”

Italy, home to the most Unesco heritage sites in the world, is becoming wearily accustomed to episodes of overtourism. Last month, the mayor of Roccaraso, a popular Italian ski resort, clamped down on daytrippers after the town was overwhelmed by 260 buses carrying more than 10,000 visitors from Naples and the surrounding Campania region, lured by a TikTok star.

But Etna, 3,300 metres (10,800ft) above sea level, is not just a ski resort. It is one of the world’s most active volcanoes, and has been in explosive form in recent weeks, spewing incandescent magma and a copious shower of ash that has reached as far as the port city of Catania on the island’s east coast.

And though visually striking, the interaction of lava and snow exposes visitors to serious risks. A BBC team and a number of tourists suffered minor injuries in 2017 when a lava flow ran into snow and produced superheated steam that pelted the group with boiling rocks.

The landscapes of its peaks are wild and nearly devoid of life, the temperatures plunge to freezing even in the height of summer and the weather is inconsistent. Bernardini and his unit rescued four young men in the middle of the night on Sunday after they had lost their way.

“We found them after hours of searching in the dark, with fog rolling in,” he says. “They were wearing sneakers and jeans and were already showing early signs of hypothermia. One of them wasn’t even wearing socks.”

In just six days since early February, 1m cubic metres of lava have erupted from Mount Etna. The lava flow – which began on 8 February from an eruptive fissure at the southern base of the Bocca Nuova crater – slowly descended to an altitude of 1,900 metres, making it more accessible to visitors. While the magma from this fissure gradually cooled, another fissure at 3,000 metres near the mountain’s south-east crater produced fresh lava flows last Monday.

Authorities fear that people may be tempted to take treacherous routes high up the volcano to experience the new flows.

Accompanied by rescuers, the Guardian trekked to the lava, across fragile ash terrain blanketed in ice where rocks from an eruption more than a year ago still smoulder and temperatures hover near -5C.

Not everyone has welcomed the restrictions. Guides and nearby residents complain that it is unfair that people are not allowed to enjoy the beauty of their own territory, due to the restrictions introduced by the mayors.

“We are used to mountain excursions,” said Danilo Spongano, 45, from Lecce, who was visiting Etna with his family. “Depriving people like us to enjoy a natural spectacle like this, I really find it a shame.”

Gabriella Cannata, a teacher who lives in Catania, has been exploring Etna for years. “There are reckless individuals who come without proper preparation,” she said, “but that shouldn’t mean penalising those who act responsibly.”

“I witnessed the latest eruption, and before leaving – by then in darkness – I turned for one last look at the lava,” Cannata said. “The scene before me was magical: the crowd of visitors had grown, each person moving around the flow with a small light on their head. It felt as if we were all part of a pilgrimage to Mother Nature.”

“In that moment,” she said, “I realised how important it is to continue being moved by the beauty of nature. Etna is a symbol of that beauty, and it deserves to be respected but also experienced.”"
Microsoft is shutting down Skype after over two decades,['Johana Bhuiyan'],2025-02-28,"Skype will ring for the last time on 5 May as owner Microsoft retires the two-decade-old internet calling service that redefined how people connect across borders.

Shutting down Skype will help Microsoft focus on its homegrown Teams service by simplifying its communication offerings, the office software giant said on Friday.

Founded in 2003, Skype quickly disrupted the landline industry in the early 2000s with its audio and video calls, making the company a household name boasting hundreds of millions of users at its peak. But the platform has struggled to keep up with easier-to-use and more reliable rivals such as Zoom and Salesforce’s Slack in recent years, in part because Skype’s underlying technology grew less suited for the smartphone era.

When the pandemic and work from home fueled the need for online business calls, Microsoft batted for Teams by aggressively integrating it with other Office apps to tap corporate users, once a major base for Skype.

Online video communication was once the near exclusive purview of Skype before the likes of FaceTime, Zoom and Google Hangouts took over. Skype was an early example of a tech product that was so ubiquitous it was used as a verb. Users would “Skype” someone in much the same way they would Google something.

When Microsoft bought Skype in 2011 for $8.5bn after outbidding Google and Facebook, its largest deal at the time, the service had about 150 million monthly users; by 2020, that number had fallen to roughly 23 million, despite a brief resurgence during the pandemic.

Over the years, Microsoft struggled to integrate Skype into its suite of tools and could not meet the moment when the company began seeing competition from Apple’s FaceTime and Google’s various communications app attempts. And when Microsoft launched its collaboration product Teams in 2017 that quickly took priority.

“We are honored to have been part of the journey,” Microsoft said on Friday. “Skype has been an integral part of shaping modern communications.”

To ease the transition from the platform, its users will be able to log into Teams for free on any supported device using their existing credentials, with chats and contacts migrating automatically.

For some, it may come as a surprise that Skype was still in operation given the company’s own years-long deprioritization of the platform. Launching successful communication tools has been a challenge for many of the big tech firms including Google. Now Skype will be laid to rest in the graveyard of communication tools alongside Duo and AOL Instant Messenger.

Microsoft declined to share the latest user figures for Skype and said there would be no job cuts due to the move. It added that Teams had about 320 million monthly active users."
Scientists create ‘e-Taste’ device that could add flavour to virtual reality experiences,['Nicola Davis'],2025-02-28,"If your colleague bores you to tears with pictures of their lunch, then a new gadget could make your life even worse.

Scientists have developed a device to recreate the flavours of food and drink, allowing them to be shared remotely in a matter of seconds – but they have not yet cracked spicy food.

They say the gadget, which they have called “e-Taste”, could be used to enhance virtual reality and augmented reality systems, boosting immersive experiences. It could also prove useful for biomedical research or even, the team suggests, for “virtual food adventures”.

“Potential applications include immersive gaming, online shopping, remote education, weight management, sensory testing, physical rehabilitation and others,” the researchers write.

However, the team notes the system requires further development, not least as there are taste sensations the device cannot reproduce, such as spiciness and fattiness.

While it is now possible share images, sounds and even physical sensations with others remotely, sharing smells or tastes has proved more challenging.

Despite previous attempts by some researchers, the team behind the new study notes that there are numerous hurdles, not least that directly stimulating the tongue electronically or with warmth only enables a few tastes to be evoked; the use of chemicals can pose problems for reliability; and the arrangement of tastebuds on the tongue means it is necessary to target particular areas to create particular sensations.

Writing in the journal Science Advances, the US-based scientists report how their e-Taste device has two key components. The first is a sensing platform – or “electronic tongue” – that captures data about the concentration of five different taste chemicals in a liquidised sample of a food or drink and sends the information wirelessly to the second component. This device uses small electromagnetic pumps to push liquids through a layer of gel containing five edible taste chemicals, allowing their delivery to an outlet, placed in a recipient’s mouth, to be controlled.

The five taste chemicals, which can be mixed before delivery, correspond to those detected in the original consumable item: glucose, which creates a sweet sensation; citric acid, which produces a sour taste; sodium chloride, which generates a salty flavour; magnesium chloride, a bitter taste; and glutamate, which elicits the savoury taste known as umami.

The team adds that the system also allows flavours to be delivered to specific regions of the tongue – something they say could be used to investigate human taste perception.

“People will get something like a straw in their mouth, and thus placing it to specific locations when needed,” said Yizhen Jia, a co-author of the study from Ohio State University.

The team then conducted a number of tests. Among them, 10 volunteers were asked to sample different sour intensities in the liquids generated by the system, with the results revealing they were able to do so with an overall accuracy rate of 70%.

In another test six volunteers were asked to sample different combinations of liquids containing the flavour chemicals, with the combinations designed to represent five different edible items – lemonade, cake, fried egg, coffee, and fish soup. They were then asked to taste a liquid generated by the system and select the foods they thought it represented. Overall they completed the task with accuracy rate of almost 87% – although spiciness is yet to be cracked.

Marianna Obrist, a professor of multisensory interfaces at University College London, who was not involved in the work, welcomed the study.

“Taste stimulation is a particularly challenging area, yet the authors seem to present a compelling integration of taste sensations to enrich digital experiences,” she said."
Russia to appoint new US ambassador as diplomatic relations thaw,['Pjotr Sauer'],2025-02-28,"Russia has announced it will appoint a new ambassador to Washington, signalling a further diplomatic thaw in relations just a day after Russian and American officials met in Istanbul to discuss strengthening ties.

Moscow said Alexander Darchiyev, a career diplomat who is currently the head of the foreign ministry’s North America department, will soon leave for the role in Washington.

Moscow has not had an envoy in the US since the last ambassador left his post in October last year.

Russia’s foreign ministry said the US had formally approved Moscow’s appointment of Darchiyev after Thursday’s talks in Istanbul, where diplomats met to discuss improving bilateral relations.

Darchiyev, 64, previously served as Russia’s ambassador to Canada from October 2014 to January 2021. He has worked for the foreign ministry since 1992 and held a senior post at the embassy in Washington earlier in his career.

In a statement published on Russia’s foreign ministry website, Moscow said it had proposed restoring direct flights between the two countries during the talks in Istanbul.

Following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine’s allies – including the US, the UK and the EU – banned Russian planes from their airspace.

On Friday, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said officials in Istanbul “agreed on joint steps to ensure the uninterrupted financing of diplomatic missions in both countries and to create appropriate conditions for diplomats to carry out their duties effectively”.

Over the past decade, Russia and the US have repeatedly expelled each other’s diplomats, significantly reducing their embassy staffing levels.

The talks in Istanbul marked the second consecutive week of meetings between Washington and Moscow, after last week’s discussions in Saudi Arabia where the two country’s vowed to improve economic relations that had been cut by the imposition of western sanctions.

The series of meetings, first set in motion by a call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin earlier this month, signal a dramatic shift in relations.

The Russian president on Thursday applauded the new US administration for “pragmatism, a realistic worldview” and described initial contacts with the Trump administration as “inspiring a certain degree of hope”.

“There is a reciprocal mood to work to restore intergovernmental ties and to gradually resolve the huge number of systemic and strategic problems that have built up in the world’s security architecture,” said Putin at a meeting with the leadership of the FSB intelligence service.

Putin also seemed to suggest that Europe and the UK were attempting to undermine negotiations between Russia and the US.

“We understand that not everyone is happy with the resumption of Russian-American contacts. Some western elites are still determined to maintain instability in the world, and these forces will try to disrupt or compromise the dialogue that has begun,” he said.

Trump’s pivot toward closer ties with Putin has sent shock waves through Europe. The leaders of the UK and France, who met the US president separately this week, have been pushing him to maintain support for Ukraine."
"China’s defence ministry warns Taiwan ‘we will get you, sooner or later’",['Helen Davidson'],2025-02-28,"China’s defence ministry spokesperson has warned Taiwan “we will come and get you, sooner or later”, after Taipei announced an expansion of military exercises.

The threat was delivered in a press conference on Thursday, but grabbed attention inside China for its apparent mirroring of a line from the record-breaking children’s movie Ne Zha 2.

Wu Qian was asked by journalists in Beijing about reports that Taiwan’s annual live-fire drills, the Han Kuang exercise, would expand in scope this year. The drills are a big part of Taiwan’s defensive preparations to deter or one day resist an attack by China, which has vowed to annex the territory.

“It is a serious miscalculation of the situation, the public opinion and the comparison of strength,” said Wu. “Overreaching itself in such a way is extremely dangerous. We warn the DPP [Democratic Progressive party] authorities that holding back the tide with a broom will only end up in self-destruction. We will come and get you, sooner or later.”

On Chinese social media, the remarks quickly drew parallels with the blockbuster children’s movie. Ne Zha 2, an animation about a young boy battling demons based on Chinese mythology, includes a scene where he admonishes a groundhog, saying: “I will come back and get you.”

Ne Zha 2 has been hugely popular in China, generating massive coverage in state media after it became the highest-grossing film in China, and then the world, overtaking the revenue of Inside Out 2. Its success has driven a surge of patriotism in China, with people reportedly viewing it numerous times, and cheering it on against Captain America: Brave New World, released in China around the same time but with lacklustre attendance.

Ne Zha 2 has not been released in Taiwan.

In response to Wu’s comments and in further criticism of recent Chinese military drills held off Taiwan’s south-west coast, the Taiwan defence ministry accused China of becoming the biggest “troublemaker” in the international community.

“This year marks the 80th anniversary of (the end of) world war two, and history has proven that any form of aggression and expansion will end in failure,” it said in a statement. “The actions of the communist military in recent years are repeating the mistakes of the invaders and pushing China towards defeat.”

China’s military is pushing on with modernisation efforts, designed to reach capability of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. Last week, it amended regulations to emphasise that the military’s top responsibility should be “winning battles”, and ordered the military to “focus on preparation and readiness for combat”.

Bill Bishop, a China expert behind the Sinocism newsletter, said on Friday that Beijing’s language towards Taiwan “appears to be getting harsher”. The readout of this year’s Taiwan affairs work conference, held earlier this week, did not include a goal to “promote the peaceful development of cross-strait relations”, which had been part of the 2023 and 2024 readouts.

Taiwan is boosting its defences but remains vastly outgunned by China. Its greatest backer has historically been the US, but that has come into question under the second presidency of Donald Trump.

This week, Trump refused to say if the US would come to Taiwan’s defence militarily in the event of a Chinese attack. The stance is in line with the US’s longstanding doctrine of strategic ambiguity, but is a departure from his predecessor, Joe Biden, who repeatedly suggested the US would defend Taiwan under his leadership.

Trump’s stance, taken with previous comments questioning the worth of supporting Taiwan and accusing it of “stealing” US semiconductor business, has raised alarm in Taipei."
Macron says French-Algerian author under ‘arbitrary detention’ in Algeria,['Ella Creamer'],2025-02-28,"The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has said he is concerned about the “arbitrary detention” and health of Boualem Sansal, days after the French-Algerian author began a hunger strike over his imprisonment in Algeria.

On Tuesday, Pen America issued a statement calling for the immediate release of 75-year-old Sansal, noting that “his hunger strike adds to grave concerns for his wellbeing”.

In November, the writer was arrested on national security charges and subsequently hospitalised. A group of prominent writers including Salman Rushdie, Annie Ernaux, Wole Soyinka and Leïla Slimani signed a statement calling for his release.

Macron has spoken out about Sansal’s detention before, telling French ambassadors in January that Algeria was “dishonouring itself” by holding the writer.

His latest comments came on Friday during a speech in Porto, Portugal, in which he said that Sansal’s imprisonment was among the issues that needed settling before confidence between France and Algeria could be fully restored, according to Reuters.

Relations between France and its former colony have become increasingly hostile in recent months over immigration and a sovereignty dispute over Western Sahara, which Algeria has long said should be independent. Last summer, Macron sparked anger in Algiers when he backed Morocco’s plan for the territory to come under Moroccan control.

Sansal’s arrest was linked to comments the writer had made to the far-right French outlet Frontières in which he backed the argument that Morocco’s land was truncated by colonial France in the 19th century to the benefit of what would become Algeria.

Sansal was once an Algerian civil servant, but was driven to become a writer during the Algerian civil war of the 1990s. His books include An Unfinished Business, his first to be translated into English, and 2084, for which he won the Grand Prix du Roman.

Sansal has in recent years become popular with rightwing figures for his position on Islam, with Marine Le Pen calling him a “courageous opponent of Islamism” after his arrest. Sandrine Rousseau – a member of the green party Europe Écologie Les Verts, denounced his imprisonment, but called his views a “form of supremacism”.

“Writers like Boualem Sansal do not belong behind bars,” said Karin Karlekar, Pen America’s director of Writers at Risk, on Tuesday. “Algeria must honour its international obligations, uphold his human rights, and the rights of all detained writers in the country.”"
Saudi border forces accused of killing ‘hundreds of Ethiopian migrants’,['Fred Harter'],2025-02-28,"Saudi Arabia’s forces are accused of using indiscriminate force against migrants on their borders, with reports of deaths and injuries and multiple accounts of women being raped.

Ethiopian migrants attempting to cross from neighbouring Yemen between 2019 and 2024 have given accounts to the Guardian of coming under machine gun fire and of seeing bodies rotting in the border area.

“I personally saw three people die next to me,” said one Ethiopian, who attempted to cross at night into Saudi’s Najran province with dozens of others in 2022. “One of my legs was blown away by the Saudi fire. There were body parts of the injured and the dead all around me.”

Another migrant talked of sustaining shrapnel wounds to his leg and back. A third alleged witnessing the rape of three Ethiopian women by men in Saudi border guard uniforms. Others described beatings and sexual assault.

Another man, who attempted to cross in January 2023, said: “The journey was particularly horrifying. Along the way, we encountered many decomposing bodies that had been eaten by animals. The border guards continued to fire at us as we walked through treacherous terrain.”

Bullets hit two young women, he said. “One was struck in the chest, and the other was struck in the back of her neck. Both the girls died instantly. Many migrants fell off a cliff while trying to escape. Others were captured or injured by gunfire. We have no idea what happened to them. We don’t know whether the two girls were ever buried.”

The testimonies reflect the findings of a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published in August 2023, which found that Saudi border guards killed “hundreds of Ethiopian migrants and asylum seekers” on the southern border with Yemen from March 2022 to June 2023 “in a pattern that is widespread and systematic” using guns and explosive weaponry. The group concluded that these actions may amount to crimes against humanity.

HRW documented one incident when Saudi border guards shot an Ethiopian man who refused to rape two girls after their group survived an explosive weapons attack. They then forced a teenage boy to rape the girls, according to HRW. In another, Saudi border guards asked Ethiopian migrants to choose in which part of their body they preferred to be shot before shooting them at close range.

“There is a complete culture of impunity and unaccountability at the border,” said Nadia Hardman, who authored the HRW report. “It’s impossible to know the true scale of the killings. No one has independent access to these areas. They are basically off limits.”

A spokesperson for the Saudi Arabian government and the Saudi embassy in Ethiopia have been contacted for comment on the allegations.

Saudi Arabia hosts about 750,000 Ethiopian migrants. More than half are believed to have entered illegally. These irregular migrants endure perilous desert treks and sea crossings and rampant abuses by people smugglers, armed gangs and Yemeni rebel groups before they even reach the Saudi border. Those who make it find low-paid work in construction, on farms and as domestic servants.

In recent years, Saudi authorities have launched security operations to detain tens of thousands of illegal migrants and deported them back to Ethiopia. Ahead of hosting the football World Cup in 2034 and building 11 new stadiums, Saudi Arabia is coming under increased scrutiny over migrant workers’s conditions.

The Ethiopians travelling illegally via Yemen in search of work are from areas affected by civil conflict, poverty and the climate crisis. Between 2022 and 2023, the number of Ethiopians making this dangerous journey surged by 32% to reach 96,670, according to the UN. A smaller number of Somalis also take the route.

There is no sign Saudia Arabia has stopped using deadly force to thwart irregular crossings. One Ethiopian migrant, who tried to reach the country from a Yemeni settlement called Al Raqw in December 2024, described Saudi border forces targeting him and 10 other Ethiopians with machine guns and artillery to push them back into Yemen, wounding one.

“Saudi Arabia has thrown its money around to get into the diplomatic fold,” said Hardman from HRW. “It doesn’t really matter what it does, the world just moves on. Unless states dealing with Saudi Arabia send a message saying they will not tolerate abuses, they will sadly continue.”

One man travelled to Yemen in the hope of reaching Saudi Arabia after serving for nearly two years as a rebel fighter in the war that gripped Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region in 2020-2022. Although a ceasefire ended the bloodshed, it did not entice back enough tourists for him to resume work as a guide.

When he arrived in Yemen, he said he was held and tortured by traffickers until his family paid a ransom. After his release, in early 2024, he worked for other smugglers in Al Raqw to pay off the debt, running hidden market cigarettes and other items into Saudi Arabia on trails used by migrants.

“I saw many dead bodies along the way,” he said. “Every trip there would be dead bodies: five in one place, two or three in another. This was normal. There were fresh bodies who had been killed recently. There were bodies that had been there for a while, badly decomposing. Some were skeletons.”

He said he saw cameras on the border, which he believes Saudi guards used to detect migrant movements. He was detained and forcibly deported back to Ethiopia where he spoke to the Guardian at a coffee shop in his home town of Wukro, whose buildings bear the bullet marks of the Tigray war, and which has a long history of migration to the Gulf.

Another man from Wukro spoke from inside Saudi Arabia. He described trying to cross the border four times from 2021 to 2023 and being fired upon and, in May 2023, his group – mostly women – was detained at a border post. He says guards raped three of the women in a building. “After the rapes, the border guards pushed us back, forcing us to return [to Yemen].”

His fourth attempt was successful and he now scrapes a living as a goatherd in the kingdom, earning 800 Saudi riyals (about £170 a month) and sending the bulk of his earnings to family in Ethiopia.

He lives in constant fear. “I can’t say I’m truly living because, at any moment, the Saudi authorities could come and arrest me or even kill me. I can’t sleep peacefully. I always fear they will show up. I can truly say, life here in Saudi is hell on earth.”

The Guardian was unable to obtain comment from the Saudi authorities about these allegations."
‘Back injuries’ and ‘a tripping hazard’: New Orleans officials still resisting anti-ramming barriers after deadly vehicle attack,['Ramon Antonio Vargas'],2025-02-28,"At least some public safety officials in New Orleans evidently remain skeptical of easily deployable, 700lb steel barriers designed to prevent intentional vehicle ramming attacks – even after one carried out on the city’s most famous street on New Year’s Day killed 14 people and injured 67 others, according to a trove of government emails obtained by the Guardian.

Received through a public records request, the emails detail how the inventor of so-called Archer barriers – which the city had bought but kept in storage on the day of the deadly Bourbon Street attack – encountered a measure of resistance when he traveled to New Orleans with his company of his own volition to train local authorities on how to expeditiously deploy the barricades.

Police officers “were not thrilled with the notion that they were responsible for deploying and breaking down the barriers” whenever they were going to be used, a process that on Bourbon Street could be completed in 20 minutes, Archer creator Peter Whitford wrote in an email to New Orleans’s municipal director of homeland security and emergency preparedness, Collin Arnold.

“The concern was about back injuries and police work versus public works [employees] doing the work,” Whitford wrote in the message, sent 12 days after the attack. Alluding to longstanding staffing shortages at the New Orleans police department, one of the officers “expressed that this was not part of their job description, and if someone got injured then they would be down a person, and there is not enough resources to back fill”.

Meanwhile, at another point, Arnold received an email from New Orleans’s public safety and homeland security director, retired high-ranking police commander John Thomas, which described the Archer barriers from Whitford’s Meridian Rapid Defense Group as “very dangerous”.

The email said the barriers pose “a tripping hazard” and have “sharp edges” that could hurt anyone pushed into them. The message also suggested the Archer barriers had little practical use if they are not “movable quickly for emergencies” – which they are – and had to be permanently left in place upon being deployed, which they are not.

Ultimately, as the city beefed up crowd security ahead of hosting the NFL’s Super Bowl on 9 February and then prepared to host its annual celebration of Carnival culminating in Mardi Gras on 4 March, New Orleans officials have used their Archer barriers in certain spots rather than stowing them away. Yet an announced agreement for the barriers to shield large sections of New Orleans’s main Mardi Gras parade route was later scuttled, Whitford said in a recent interview.

Police officials declined to comment on the emails related to the Archer barriers, citing various investigations into the Bourbon Street attack as well as pending litigation from injured victims or families of the slain who have accused the city of failing to adequately protect New Year’s revelers.

But Whitford faulted a disagreement over the division of labor for the New Orleans government’s palpable skepticism to a type of barrier that on New Year’s Day 2024 prevented a woman with a history of mental illness from plowing a car into a crowd of spectators at the Rose Parade in Pasadena, California, where the Meridian firm is based.

“Where the benefit for everyone would be is police should be doing police work, fire should be doing fire work and emergency services should be providing emergency services,” Whitford said. “And I think public works or the private sector should be responsible for putting out equipment” like the Archer barriers.

Spokespeople for New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration did not respond to a request for comment. The administration ostensibly oversees a municipal government division tasked with “providing physical security at … events”, and it has the authority to enter into arrangements with private service providers.

New Orleans acquired 41 Archer barriers in 2017 under the administration of Cantrell’s mayoral predecessor, Mitch Landrieu, as part of a $40m public safety package implemented as a countermeasure to deadly car rammings aimed at crowds in Nice, Berlin, London, New York and Barcelona.

Nonetheless, when crowds descended on Bourbon Street to celebrate the beginning of 2025 less than two weeks after a deadly truck attack at a German Christmas market, New Orleans officials left their Archer barriers stowed away. Officials also left down two other kinds of blockades meant to protect crowds from motorists meaning them harm – road-blocking, cylindrical bollards and a wedge barrier that can be hydraulically raised or lowered in seconds.

City officials had varied explanations when confronted after a former US military member sympathetic to the Islamic State (IS) terror group’s cause drove a pickup truck up three blocks of Bourbon Street, killing or injuring more than 70 people before he crashed and was killed in a shootout with police.

They said the bollards needed repairs after being worn down by the rigors of one of the world’s most zealously festive thoroughfares. The wedge barrier allegedly had a history of malfunctioning, though the manufacturer later said the city essentially ignored its offer to inspect and repair the product if necessary.

As for the Archer barriers, six days after the attack, Arnold went on a local radio station and conceded that they are effective at tilting back if struck by a motorist, getting “tangled under the vehicle and dig[ging] into the street and … [doing] a massive amount of damage”.

He complained, however, that “moving them takes significant effort that must be thought of a couple of days before”.

“And once they’re deployed, moving them takes usually two to three people,” he added.

Two days after Arnold’s remarks, the president of an independent government watchdog group sent an email to LeJon Roberts, the New Orleans police commander in charge of officers patrolling Bourbon Street and the surrounding French Quarter neighborhood.

The email from the president of the New Orleans metropolitan crime commission, Rafael Goyeneche, contained a link to a YouTube video which showed a woman with gray hair effortlessly and single-handedly pushing and pulling an Archer barrier, using equipment from Meridian allowing one to assemble what is essentially a hand dolly cart.

“Do you have access [to] these?” Goyeneche wrote.

Roberts replied: “The two we have are inoperable due to damage.” The reply conspicuously did not say when police realized they were broken – or if they took steps to either repair or replace them.

Asked for comment on that exchange, Goyeneche said he recalled trading emails with Roberts but declined to elaborate much. He did say he got the impression that this equipment “must have been put away and forgotten about” – and that he thought it was unusual this “type of stuff … [would be] the police department’s responsibility”.

Meanwhile, Whitford described initially having repeated telephone calls to various city officials unreturned after the attack. He eventually got through to Arnold, who on 9 January informed Cantrell and other members of her staff that Meridian would come to town to update the city’s supply of Archers.

The company would also “set them up appropriately and provide training” to police, Arnold wrote.

It was in the ensuing days when Whitford encountered officers’ concerns about possible back injuries and musings about whether other municipal employees were better suited for the work.

Despite that, during Super Bowl week and in advance of Carnival, Meridian’s barriers have been seen along Bourbon Street and at other spots in the French Quarter. That included the city’s Jackson Square and nearby St Louis cathedral, where light shows were projected on the building’s exterior. They were also seen erected outside New Orleans’s Saenger Theater, which hosted the NFL Honors ceremony recognizing the league’s best from the preceding season.

Meridian then announced that the city had agreed to rent about 900 additional barriers to protect the city’s traditional Mardi Gras parade route largely along its iconic St Charles Avenue in time for when the peak of the festive season kicked off on 21 February. Emails showed the arrangement would cost the city $200 a barrier for each day of parades, with any Meridian staffers hired to oversee specific access points costing a daily fee of $750.

Whitford said the city expressed a willingness to pay for the arrangement. But a disagreement over whether to completely ban vehicular traffic along the route at certain times on days with parades – rather than only on the side of the street used by the floats and marching units – prompted Meridian and New Orleans officials to effectively cancel the agreement.

After hiring former New York and Los Angeles police chief William Bratton to harden its security plans for the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras, city officials have lined the side of St Charles open to motorists ahead of parades with water-filled barricades designed to serve as impediments that drivers must slow down to get around. The barriers are arrayed to create what is known as a “serpentine” traffic pattern – or, in car racing parlance, a series of chicanes.

Officials have also resorted to lining the St Charles median – or, as New Orleans refers to it, the neutral ground – where many spectators gather early to watch parades with concrete barriers, which can be effective in deflecting sidelong blows from cars.

WWL Louisiana also reported that Cantrell is considering making Bourbon Street exclusively for pedestrians rather than continuing to permit car traffic at times when crowds aren’t as dense.

Unlike Archer barriers, Whitford said, neither concrete nor water-filled barricades are certified by the US’s homeland security department under a congressional act incentivizing anti-terrorism technology.

Yet Whitford said he was glad the city had implemented those measures at least, when in years past neither were present.

“They have made some improvements in safety – it’s reasonable to say that,” Whitford said that. “For it to be the safest possible, it would be shutting down [the route] entirely.

“And the city is heading in that direction. But they have still made a decision not to make this a pedestrian [only] event; they’ve made a decision to allow some vehicle traffic.”"

The mistake was spotted only after two employees had missed it, and a third employee rectified it 90 minutes after it was posted, the Financial Times reported. No funds left the bank.

The bank disclosed the “near miss” to the US Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

A transaction of $81tn (£64tn) would be so huge that it would be unlikely to go through any bank’s systems. It would have certainly gone down as one of the biggest ever fat finger errors, in which the wrong number is entered in a computer system.

The sum would be more than enough to buy the entire US stock market, including all of the big tech companies, at a healthy premium. The US stock market was valued at $62tn at the end of 2024, according to the Current Market Valuation website.

The amount would be also be enough to buy all of the assets of Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, more than 200 times over. His fortune is valued at $343bn, according to Bloomberg’s billionaires index.

The total stock of global wealth was estimated at about $450tn by UBS last year. The total wealth of the UK was estimated at $16tn in 2022.

A Citi spokesperson said: “Despite the fact that a payment of this size could not actually have been executed, our detective controls promptly identified the inputting error between two Citi ledger accounts and we reversed the entry. Our preventative controls would have also stopped any funds leaving the bank.

“While there was no impact to the bank or our client, the episode underscores our continued efforts to continue eliminating manual processes and automating controls through our transformation.”

It was not the first fat finger error for Citi, which has previously faced criticisms of its internal systems. In 2020 it accidentally sent $900m to creditors of the cosmetics company Revlon. It took two years of legal battles for the bank to recover much of the money from several hedge funds, and the saga contributed to the departure of the Citigroup chief executive, Michael Corbat.

The bank was fined £61.6m in the UK last year after a banker tried to sell stocks worth $58m in May 2022. However, the fat-fingered trader accidentally sold shares worth $1.4bn, causing a “flash crash” in European stock markets. The unidentified trader scrolled past error messages without reading them.

The Financial Times reported that Citi experienced 10 near misses of more than $1bn last year, citing an internal report.

In 2014, a trader cancelled orders for shares in 42 Japanese companies worth 67.78tn yen (£380bn) before they could be made."
‘I chose to NOT follow the gutless rules’: Francis Ford Coppola says he’s ‘thrilled’ by Golden Raspberry votes,['Catherine Shoard'],2025-02-28,"Francis Ford Coppola has said he was “thrilled” to accept multiple Golden Raspberry nominations for his film Megalopolis, which ended up winning two awards.

On Instagram, Coppola said that he was treating the nominations, which are voted for by Razzie members, who pay for the privilege, as a “distinctive honour … when so few have the courage to go against the prevailing trends of contemporary moviemaking!”

Megalopolis, his epic sci-fi passion project – which earned largely highly critical reviews and made $14m from a $120m (£95m) outlay, much of which was bankrolled by Coppola selling off assets from his wine business – was up for six awards, including worst picture, director and screenplay.

Watch a trailer for Megalopolis

In fact, it won only two – for director, and supporting actor for Jon Voight, although he shares the honour for his work on three other films: Reagan, Shadow Land and Strangers.

“In this wreck of a world today,” continued Coppola, “where ART is given scores as if it were professional wrestling, I chose to NOT follow the gutless rules laid down by an industry so terrified of risk that despite the enormous pool of young talent at its disposal, may not create pictures that will be relevant and alive 50 years from now.

“What an honor to stand alongside a great and courageous filmmaker like Jacques Tati who impoverished himself completely to make one of cinema’s most beloved failures, PLAYTIME! My sincere thanks to all my brilliant colleagues who joined me to make our work of art, MEGALOPOLIS, and let us remind ourselves us that box-office is only about money, and like war, stupidity and politics has no true place in our future.”

In interviews for the film, Coppola sought to define his movie as just the latest in a series of classics that went unrecognised as such by contemporary critics.

A trailer for Megalopolis took a similar tack, quoting well-known critics’ disparaging verdicts of Coppola classics such as Apocalypse Now, The Conversation and the Godfather. However, the trailer was taken down after it emerged that all the quotes were made up."
"Stadium-ready UK singer Myles Smith: ‘For the working class, music opportunities are few and far between’",['Ben Beaumont-Thomas'],2025-02-28,"Myles Smith’s song Stargazing – a thumping pop-hoedown full of stadium-sized chants and euphoric romance – was one of the biggest hits by a British artist last year, racking up nearly 700m streams on Spotify, spending 40 weeks on the UK chart and breaking the US Top 20. It’s also up for song of the year at this weekend’s Brit awards, where Smith is also nominated for best new artist and best pop act, having already won this year’s Brits Rising Star award. Ed Sheeran is an admirer and confidant, and has booked him as support on a stadium tour, and Smith is no one-hit-wonder either: in January, the jaunty Nice to Meet You became his second Top 10 hit.

But the weirdest moment for him, he says, was when he recently rang up a utilities company to sort a new wifi deal. “They put me on hold, and it was Stargazing playing. Those are the types of things that still seem absolutely bizarre.”

At the Brits, he is up against big names such as Charli xcx and Dua Lipa in the pop category, but his music skews very differently, towards material relatively rarely explored by Black British pop artists. Animated acoustic guitars and banjos mean that it cleaves to the trend for pop-leaning country music as well as the barn-dancing “stomp-clap” style of Mumford & Sons and the Lumineers. But with pianos, ethereal production touches and Smith’s open-hearted yet bruised vocal style – plus plenty of whoa-oh-ohs – the likes of Sheeran, Coldplay and Hozier are clearly touchstones too, and even dance music fans will be endeared to his insistent beats and big breakdowns.

With abundant emotional intelligence as well as a keener political acumen than most pop singers his age, the 26-year-old Smith is sharp and engaging company on a video call as he tours the UK. Born and raised in Luton, he casts himself as a small-town oddball. “I grew up in a working-class neighbourhood, in a Jamaican family – so my interest in rock and screamo, and not being able to play football and rugby, instantly put me in a different category to my peers,” he says. “In all walks of life I’ve felt a little bit different.”

His parents’ marriage fell apart when Smith was between the ages of nine and 13, “a critical period in anyone’s life when they’re forming relationships,” he says. Introducing a song to his 1.6m TikTok followers recently, he wryly said: “Anyone else’s parents divorce and then your dad leaves and then your whole perception of love and relationships is completely screwed up and you don’t know how to trust anyone in your adult life?”

“A lot of my personal development has been off the back of that [divorce] experience,” he says now. “I definitely had trust issues for a while.” He has had therapy – “such a beautiful tool” – to come to terms with it. “At the time [as a child] you’re never really aware – most of the learning comes when you’re an adult and you start to unpack the ways you think and feel. There’s a weird beauty to it – while it is painful and traumatic, and having to relive so many experiences is difficult, it also gives you this key to unlock a whole new side to yourself, when you do understand yourself better. And I’ve got a lot of [the trauma] to thank for being a good songwriter!”

Smith left Luton for the University of Nottingham to study sociology, and founded his own fast-growing business management company after graduating. But he’d been playing pub gigs since the age of 11, and decided to pivot to music, “knowing that if it all went wrong I could reactivate my LinkedIn and get back into the working world,” he laughs. “But those initial months were petrifying, stepping from a stable income to absolute uncertainty.” He started posting songs to TikTok in 2022, where his manager discovered him, and was signed to a major label deal with Sony the following year.

But I can hear the sociology student still coming through when he discusses the systemic issues that can hold people like him back in the music industry. “For anyone from a working-class town, the opportunities to get into music are few and far between,” he says. “There’s a huge disadvantage when it comes to access to musical equipment, and even music lessons, at state school level.”

Smith benefited from Building Schools for the Future, an investment scheme brought in by Labour in 2005, then shuttered in 2010 by Michael Gove – who later regretted doing so – as the Tories’ austerity programme began. “I had access to GarageBand, iMacs, musical equipment,” Smith remembers. “And though the costing could be questioned, [the scheme] was very quickly pushed out the window. We’ve now seen years and years of austerity, and it’s not just the arts that have taken a hit – it’s anything that sits on the periphery of the mainstream route to work. There do need to be questions asked about how we’re valuing the arts in this country.”

Exacerbating the problem are the hardships faced by grassroots venues, which have been knocked hard by the Covid lockdowns and then the cost of living crisis. “Suddenly the gap between music being a hobby and being a career is wider than ever. In order to pay for a first show an artist might need to sell 500 tickets [at a medium-sized venue]. Whereas the bands and shows I used to see when I was younger was someone down the pub playing to 20 people, but those don’t exist any more.” And he sees a “dual burden” for people of colour, who as well as being statistically more likely to be working class, “are also not being seen for the amazing cultural value that they bring to this country, and what they add to one of our biggest cultural exports” – namely the arts. “More work needs to be done both on a class basis and a race basis.”

His music tends to be much less political, and is written in a way that allows listeners to map their own troubles and breakthroughs on to his songs. They frequently contact him to tell him so, and on social media, Smith recently reminded them: “It wasn’t my music that saved you – it was you.”

“A lot of people – and I really do appreciate it – will message me when they’re going through troublesome times,” he explains. “They’re dealing with mental health issues – or much further. I could take it as an ego lift: ‘Wow, I’m saving lives!’ But the reality is that those people are doing the hard work to really understand themselves. As an artist, I never want to put a false sense of myself into the world, where I am this saviour. I push air – that’s my job.”

As he hones his craft, Smith says he’s mindful to “take breaks from writing for a few months at a time, so I can go out and experience life, otherwise I’ll have nothing to say,” and also avoiding “external [musical] influence – I’m trying to find who I am, what I’m trying to say.” But time with Sheeran has been useful, seeing how “he has full confidence over his initial ideas. For me and many other songwriters, you can get stuck going over one line for 45 minutes. But he’s of the mindset that if it’s good, it’s good – why are we wasting time?”

After the Brit awards, Smyth has 37 gigs to play across Europe, the US and Australia – all before the end of May, when he starts 29 European stadium shows with Sheeran. It sounds exhausting, but he is clearly exhilarated. “I wrote a song recently about simply feeling good,” he says. “On the surface that could seem super cliched. But it’s taken a long time to just feel great, and not feel burdened with anything. That’s a byproduct of doing the thing that I love. Feeling good – that’s something I’ve been feeling recently!”"
"Sora, OpenAI’s video generator, has hit the UK. It’s obvious why creatives are worried",['Dan Milmo'],2025-02-28,"If you want to know why Tyler Perry put an $800m (£635m) expansion of his studio complex on hold, type “two people in a living room in the mountains” into OpenAI’s video generation tool.

The result from artificial intelligence-powered Sora, which was released in the UK and Europe on Friday, indicates why the US TV and film mogul paused his plans.

Perry said last year after seeing previews of Sora that if he wanted to produce that mountain shot, he may not need to build sets on location or on his lot. “I can sit in an office and do this with a computer, which is shocking to me,” he said.

The result from a simple text prompt is only five seconds long – you can go to up to 20 seconds and also stitch together much longer videos from the tool – and the “actors” display telltale problems with their hands (a common problem with AI tools). But the mountain backdrop and the cosy interiors are convincing, and it only took 45 seconds to make after the text prompt was entered. The technology will also improve.

In order to access Sora users need to have a paid-for package with ChatGPT, but it is an indication of where video-generating technology is heading in the rapidly evolving AI market. It also underlines why the row over copyright has reached red-hot levels on both sides of the Atlantic.

It is obvious that video generation tools such as Sora, Kling and Runway have the potential to transform the film, TV and advertising industries. One of the UK digital artists who has experimented with the tool, Josephine Miller, told the Guardian it has expanded opportunities for “younger creatives” and she is already using it to pitch advertising concepts to brands.

OpenAI says creatives and studios in locations where Sora is already available, such as in the US, have been using it to produce film and advertising concepts and pitches.

David Jones, the chief executive of Brandtech Group, an advertising startup using generative AI to create marketing campaigns, says there is going to be “tectonic disruption” of the advertising and marketing industries due to tools such as Sora.

Jones says this is a “Kodak moment” for his industry, referring to the analogue camera film company that succumbed to the digital revolution.

Big advertisers are already embracing AI-made video. Coca-Cola produced an entirely AI-generated Christmas ad last year and the technology’s implications were outlined in a pointed tweet from Alex Hirsch, the creator of the Disney-animated series Gravity Falls.

“FUN FACT: @CocaCola is ‘red’ because it’s made from the blood of out-of-work artists!” he wrote.

The problem of artists losing out to AI has become a key battleground in development of the technology on multiple levels, not least with regard to copyright. AI systems such as Sora and ChatGPT are powered by models that are trained on vast amounts of data culled from the internet. ChatGPT, which was also developed by OpenAI, is the subject of lawsuits claiming the use of artists’ work without permission is a breach of copyright.

The row deepened in the UK this week over government plans to allow AI firms to use copyrighted work without permission. The creative sector hit back with the release of a silent protest album by 1,000 musicians and an open letter from leading creative figures including Dua Lipa, Sir Tom Stoppard and Sir Paul McCartney warning that the government was on the verge of agreeing a “wholesale giveaway of rights and income from the UK creative sectors to big tech”.

Sora and its peers are not at the forefront of that row, but they clearly represent a competitive threat to artists who want recompense if their work has been used to create these tools – and their content. YouTube’s chief executive warned last year that it would be a breach of the platform’s terms of service if OpenAI had used YouTube content to train Sora’s model. Reports have already pointed to Sora’s apparent familiarity with gaming content.

Beeban Kidron, an award-winning film-maker and crossbench peer who has spoken out against the UK government’s plans, has told the Guardian that Sora’s arrival adds “another layer of urgency” to the debate.

Tyler Perry is not the only creative who is concerned."
Revered in Riyadh but nixed in New York: how The Little Prince (almost) conquered the world,['Lyndsey Winship'],2025-02-28,"After the Bible, The Little Prince is the most translated book in the world. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s short, sweet novella has spawned more than 600 translations and counting, the author’s great-nephew Olivier d’Agay tells me. And this surreal story of an aviator who crashes in the desert and meets a small princely boy who has travelled from his own tiny planet is still picking up fans globally. “In Brazil, China, the Middle East,” laughs d’Agay. “Even England.”

The book was first published in 1943 in New York, pilot and writer Saint-Exupéry having fled occupied France. It may be “an ambassador for French culture” as d’Agay puts it, but the innocent wisdom of its central character clearly taps into something universal. Over the years, there have been countless adaptations and tie-ins worldwide – and the latest is a dance-circus show, by choreographer Anne Tournié, which has already toured to 18 cities, from Riyadh to Mumbai to Sydney to Sofia. Its now about to land in London.

The book was partly a critique of consumerist culture in the US – and that’s where they got their only bad review

In every theatre, there has been a different response. Tournié was surprised how famous the book was in Bulgaria: “The room was packed,” she says. But the liveliest audiences were in Istanbul: “They were applauding before anything happened, warming up the room.” In Luxembourg, people were more restrained: “Heavier, like their sausages,” says composer Terry Truck. And in Saudi Arabia, people cheered at the scene when it rains in the desert.

Co-director Chris Mouron appears on stage to narrate parts of the tale (speaking French, with local translation in surtitles) but the nature of the storytelling, through dance, acrobatics and aerialism, lends itself to crossing international borders. The characters the Little Prince meets along his journey through the universe are all spelled out in their movements: the beautiful Rose he loves is elegantly balletic; a drunkard is lopingly rubber-bodied (they were concerned about that one in non-drinking Saudi Arabia, where the character is cut from the book version, but people laughed); the king draws on courtly classical technique; the conceited man uses show-offy leaps and spins; and the acrobatic lamplighter climbs a Chinese pole suspended in the air.

Marie Jumelin’s projections, meanwhile, conjure up multiple worlds where the prince, with his mop of blond hair and philosophical turn of phrase, meets these deluded characters often consumed by pride, greed or power (it’s a moralistic tale, without doubt), and Truck’s score draws on musical styles from around the globe.

They first tried the show out in Marseille – apparently its audiences are the most brutally honest – and it passed that test. Perhaps that’s because the prince’s gnomic pronouncements (“It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye”) are part of the vernacular in France. They had rave reviews in Paris, but somewhat less enthusiastic ones on Broadway, where the show closed three months early.

I tell Mouron that I read the New York Times review. “Very bad,” she laughs and shakes her head. “It’s funny – that’s the only bad critique we had.” She adds that the book was in part a critique of American consumerist culture. “I think Saint-Exupéry was inspired by the materialism he saw in New York.” Critics there found this production too whimsical. “Well, the story’s whimsical,” says Truck. “It’s not a big singing and dancing musical.”

Tournié has made plenty of spectacular shows in the past. Her background is originally in ballet and she has worked with Robert Wilson and Robert Lepage, but recently she’s been creating vast extravaganzas in Las Vegas, Abu Dhabi and Macau, with stunts and acrobatics, big sets and lots of tech. This was a deliberate move away from that scale. “After 10 years of that, I wanted a simple show that was just human,” she says, because the story itself is about coming back to simple, human values.

It’s tricky to capture the particular voice of the book on stage, and there’s a randomness to its strange world – it starts with some dancing sheep, for example. The mood is often melancholy and the show is strongest when it reaches for some emotional heart, themes of loneliness and friendship and our responsibilities to each other (and our planet, too). The message is about caring for the people and the environment around you, tending your own garden as it were, rather than trying to take ownership of the stars – as the “businessman” character does. Which all seems very pertinent for a story written eight decades ago.

The odd bad review is certainly not going to sink The Little Prince. “It’s not a question of culture or generation, it’s just talking to the humanity in people,” says d’Agay of its endurance. “We still have the same questions, the same quest for meaning. Humanity has not changed.”"
A cosmic Jackson Pollock: Kathleen Kennedy’s Star Wars tenure has been marked by chaos,['Ben Child'],2025-02-28,"If the reports are true, and Kathleen Kennedy is to step down as president of Lucasfilm, it is possible to look back on her near 13-year reign over the Star Wars movies and wonder how one person managed to oversee an entire industry of sci-fi fantasy dreams, decrees and doomed announcements that always seemed to fall apart as quickly as they were constructed. Like any of the Death Stars that have permeated these films, Kennedy’s apparently well-constructed visions for future episodes always seemed to be blown to smithereens just as they were about to take over the Hollywood nebula. From Josh Trank’s mysteriously vanished Boba Fett film to Patty Jenkins’ Rogue Squadron crash-landing before takeoff, her time at the helm of Lucasfilm will be marked by vast, ambitious projects that promised to be “fully operational” – only for the scrappy reality of budget concerns and creative differences to transform them into little more than unfinished, floating chunks of cinematic debris, drifting aimlessly through the void.

It is fair to say that while her predecessor George Lucas procrastinated, toiled, and employed as much energy as a protocol droid attempting to jog through quicksand, Kennedy, in terms of bringing new Star Wars films to the multiplexes (after the mixed reception to his midichlorian-infested, blue-screen-heavy prequel trilogy), moved like a hyperspace-jumping Millennium Falcon. Initially at least: no sooner had the ink dried on Disney’s galactically ambitious purchase of Lucasfilm for a $4.5bn (£2.5bn) in 2012 than Kennedy was off hunting down JJ Abrams to oversee 2015’s The Force Awakens. It was a movie that – at the time – felt as if fans of the saga had finally been gifted a return to the knockabout space romps of Lucas’s original trilogy – but these days it feels like a gleaming hyperspace lane to nowhere: a void at the heart of everything that is wrong about modern-day Star Wars.

The sequel trilogy was grand, kinetic and beautifully shot – the memory of the splendid scene in which Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren first lands on Jakku in his sinister-looking command shuttle will always stick in the cerebrum. But now that we know the whole thing ended up with space-zombie Palpatine coming back from the dead with his armada of planet-killing Star Destroyers, hooded Sith acolytes, and what can only be described as an infinite supply of evil red mood lighting, there’s a nagging sense that the creative team spent most of their time mugging up cool cosmic designs rather than worrying about unimportant guff such as character and story arc, thematic consistency and any semblance of a long-term plan.

Yes, the sequel trilogy was technically impressive, occasionally dazzling, and sold a lot of toys. But it ultimately flickered in and out of coherence like an astromech droid with a low battery – bleeping optimistically for a while before toppling over lifelessly, right into the bottomless abyss of forgotten plotlines. There are moments of visually operatic splendour, segues and set pieces in which it feels as if our eyes are popping out on stalks. Let us not forget those battered Resistance ski speeders carving scarlet streaks across the battlefield while facing down the approaching enemy walkers on Crait’s salt-encrusted surface in Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, or the dazzling throne room duel where Kylo Ren and Rey briefly set aside their differences to slice through Snoke’s Praetorian Guard in a ballet of crackling lightsabers and burning red drapery in what felt like a moment of raw, operatic grandeur ripped straight from the Star Wars of our dreams.

But the overall sense was of a film trilogy directed by talented but completely out-of-sync directors operating with little sense of where they were supposed to be going, of creatives who would have benefited from being given a star map from A to B, rather than just being handed the keys to the Millennium Falcon.

For other than the sequel trilogy, what does Kennedy have to show for her time? She stepped in to prevent Gareth Edwards’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story from being a disastrous mess; Edwards’s majestic prelude to the original trilogy may go down as one of the best films in the saga, of any era. But reports from the period always suggested that if Tony Gilroy had not salvaged and reshot it, it might have been a complete disaster. Credit then, where credit is due, and these behind-the-scenes power struggles, 11th-hour rewrites and white-knuckle reshoots ultimately led to Gilroy being given free rein on the fabulously dour and doomy Rogue One Disney+ prequel series Andor. The Mandalorian is so good it has survived three seasons and is about to head to the big screen with the forthcoming The Mandalorian & Grogu. Yet all of this feels more like firefighting than smart planning; nobody can really suggest that the grand idea from the beginning was to mainline the entirety of Star Wars around a pseudo-Lone Wolf and Cub dynamic that conveniently sidesteps any real reckoning with the total muddle left behind by Abrams et al.

And it’s not over, just yet. Even if Kennedy does retire at the end of the year, at least five more mooted Star Wars movies are at various stages of pre-production. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is set to direct a film focusing on Daisy Ridley’s character, Rey, as she establishes a new Jedi Order, while James Mangold is developing an episode exploring the origins of everyone’s beloved space monks set approximately 25,000 years before the original trilogy. Dave Filoni will direct a film set during the New Republic era, intended as a cinematic apex for Disney+ shows such as The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and The Book of Boba Fett, and Shawn Levy is in talks to direct a standalone Star Wars film that might just star Ryan Gosling in the lead. Then there’s Lando, in which Donald Glover is set to reprise his role as Lando Calrissian, co-writing the script with his brother, Stephen Glover.

Any one of these movies might spin Star Wars off in a completely new, utterly brilliant direction, but is just as likely to be as stimulating as a Senate debate on trade route taxation. Unfortunately, this feels like part of the problem. If your job is to decide where this sprawling, lore-laden galaxy of Jedi, Sith, bounty hunters and increasingly bewildered audiences goes next, there ought to be a plan that’s more precise than just throwing hyperspace coordinates at the wall, like some cosmic Jackson Pollock, and seeing what sticks."
"Ron Perlman on Hellboy, the LA fires and Trump: ‘A snake-oil con-artist who’d sell you bad vodka and swampland in New Jersey’",['Ryan Gilbey'],2025-02-28,"Ron Perlman could be mistaken for Will Ferrell’s grumpy older brother. Today, however, he mostly looks trapped. That slab of a face, frosted with a white beard and moustache, seems too formidable to be contained by the narrow vertical frame of his iPad camera. Wearing a stonewashed grey denim jacket over a black shirt, he peers down at me, brow crinkled, as if from a great height. It’s like being on a Zoom call with Goliath.

Though he introduces himself as “Ron from Brooklyn”, the actor, who is a few weeks shy of 75, is sitting at home in Los Angeles. No, the fires didn’t touch him, but the nearest ones were only three miles away, close enough to make him jittery. “Scary times,” he says. His voice rumbles like a freight train. Tom Waits, whom he was once plausibly but falsely rumoured to be playing in a movie, sounds like Charles Hawtrey by comparison.

Perlman has lived in LA since the 1980s, when he was one of the leads in the hit romantic fantasy series Beauty and the Beast. (The Terminator’s Linda Hamilton was the other.) He won a Golden Globe award and received two Emmy nominations for the show. But Perlman’s fame was curiously manageable. He got the best restaurant tables, yet no one knew what he really looked like beneath the leonine disguise he wore for the role. One magazine voted him the sexiest man of the year – in his Beast makeup.

No prosthetics were needed for his new film, the atmospheric, old-fashioned, black-and-white boxing drama Day of the Fight, in which he plays Stevie, who is training Irish Mike (Michael Pitt) for his latest bout. “When you say ‘old-fashioned’, I mean, sure, no one’s wearing spandex,” Perlman concedes. “But it’s all about friendship and love. Mistakes, victories and failures. To me, that’s not old-fashioned. It’s the kind of movie I could wallow in for days.”

The director is Jack Huston, whose grandfather John made the sweat- and booze-soaked 1972 boxing classic Fat City. Day of the Fight conveys a decent sense of life in a spit-and-sawdust gym, and features some high-calibre cameos (Joe Pesci, Steve Buscemi). The worst you could say is that there’s not enough Ron Perlman in it. But it proves that he has few equals when it comes to evoking an entire existence in a flash. He growls his first line (“Hey asshole!”) and most of the others, which include “Kid, I love ya” and “Get da fuck outta here!”

Leading roles aren’t his thing anyway, unless you count occasional grotesques such as the carnival strongman in the twisted dreamscape of The City of Lost Children (1995), co-directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amélie), or the horned, tomato-red hero of Guillermo del Toro’s Hellboy adventures. Del Toro stood his ground against the studio, which wanted to cast The Rock or Vin Diesel, and modelled the character so closely on Perlman that when the actor flirted with using a different voice, the director said: “What are you doing? Just be Ron Perlman and that will be Hellboy.”

Personality-wise, there isn’t much separating him from his infernal alter ego. “The character’s number one charm is that he’s a bit of an underachiever,” Perlman says. “He’s a superhero who’d rather watch the Marx brothers and play with his cats and eat pizza than save the world. But he does it because the world is a fucking mess. Someone’s got to. He does it reluctantly. And that’s how I do everything.”

If Perlman sees himself as an underachiever, directors don’t agree. Many have kept coming back to him for more. He made three films with Jeunet, the best of which is the cruelly underrated Alien Resurrection (1997). Three with Jean-Jacques Annaud, too, including the ones that launched him as a film actor after a decade in theatre, and established him as the king of performing in prosthetics: first, the prehistoric Quest for Fire (1981), for which a glossary of grunts and growls was specially devised by Anthony Burgess; and second, a chilling adaptation of Umberto Eco’s medieval whodunit The Name of the Rose (1986), in which Perlman’s character was falsely accused of Satanism and burned at the stake.

Spending four or five hours in the makeup chair for these films, and for Beauty and the Beast, led to him being called the Lon Chaney of his generation. It served a psychological purpose, too. “When I was a young man, I was so uncomfortable in my own skin. I was given this gift of putting layers of stuff between me and the real world so that I could free myself to play these characters. Then in my mid-40s, I experienced a kind of détente with my body: ‘Oh, maybe you’re not so bad after all.’”

His relationship with del Toro has stretched from the Mexican auteur’s gory 1992 debut, Cronos, to Nightmare Alley (2021) and Pinocchio (2022), with only the occasional gap. “He has a feel for my skillset, which is limited,” Perlman says. Does he really think that? “Well, I was hoping you might correct me,” he deadpans. When I do, perhaps a fraction too late, he perks up: “There you go! I was spearfishing for validation and I got what I wanted.”

In 1990, del Toro, then a special-effects makeup expert, sent him a handwritten fan letter. At the meeting that followed, Perlman witnessed the budding director’s unorthodox approach to dinner. “Guillermo said, ‘I like to start with dessert.’” At the end of the meal came soup. “By the time we stood up, we were like brothers who had been separated at birth.”

Once shooting on Cronos was finished, Perlman threw a Hollywood bash for del Toro – he calls it his “I’ve found this genius film-maker and I want you all to meet him because he’s going to become one of the greats” party. Hamilton brought along her then partner James Cameron, which sparked an enduring friendship between the Avatar director and del Toro. That means Perlman can be indirectly credited for the moment at the 1998 Academy Awards when Cameron – furious that Harvey Weinstein had sacked del Toro from his second film, Mimic – nearly lamped him with the Oscar he had just won for Titanic. “We all wanted to take a crack at Harvey,” shrugs Perlman.

The closest he ever got was urinating on his own hands before pressing the flesh with the feared producer. Recounting that story on Twitter in 2018 led Perlman into a spat with Donald Trump Jr, who accused him of knowing about Weinstein’s predatory behaviour and yet doing nothing. “I never said I knew Harvey was a rapist,” Perlman shot back. “I did know he was a prick, though.”

It was the start of an outspoken streak that he has only recently reined in. He was the last of the cast members of Sons of Anarchy, the series in which he played the leader of a biker gang, to join Twitter. “They were all saying, ‘Ron, it’s fun!’ I didn’t have any desire to exercise that muscle until the arrival of our 45th – and now 47th – president. I’d grown up in New York so I knew everything there was to know about that snake-oil salesman con-artist. I was so offended to see this guy who’d sell you shitty steak and bad vodka and swampland in New Jersey now emerging in a leadership position. And yeah, it got hot and heavy.”

You could say that. At one point in 2020, Perlman challenged Republican senator Ted Cruz to a fight online. The actor was still taunting Republicans last summer, when hopes were high for Kamala Harris to take the presidency. He tweeted at Elon Musk: “Yo elon! [sic] You sweating yet?”

He was hardly alone in believing the election would have a happier outcome. How is he dealing with the fallout now? “I was gonna ask you,” he says glumly. “It’s all still as impossible to process as the fires in LA. This is going to have to run its course.”

It’s a long way from Hellboy. But then he offers a glimmer of hope: “I’m spending a lot of secretive time working on my version of counteracting. If I get lucky, I’m going to go back to being very public again.” Political ambitions? “No. A counter-movement.” Wait, what? “If I have anything to announce, I’ll come to you, I swear to God. But that’s all I’m going to say for now, my friend.”

I think back to his description of Hellboy, and how he goes off reluctantly to save the world because it’s a mess. Well, someone’s got to. Why not Ron Perlman?"
‘My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained’: how I stopped impulse buying,['Jane Hoskyn'],2025-02-27,"Introversion is rarely useful, but it saved me a fortune in my younger years. So keenly did I loathe going to the shops that I just didn’t spend much money. I was perfectly happy, albeit a little bored and usually dressed in the same clothes.

The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.

Then online shopping happened. The lure of one-click, next-day consumables unleashed my inner impulse buyer like a starving castaway at a buffet. I never quite became a shopping addict, but the thrill of home delivery fuelled a period of slightly unhinged affluenza. My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained. I accumulated retro camera kit (70% unused to this day), expensive books about using said camera kit (100% unread) and an untold number of dresses that I bought only because I could send them back for free. I never did send them back, of course, and I never wore them, because I never wear dresses. But they were so pretty.

Ending up with no money sure helped kill the habit, but I don’t want to be in that position again, so I’ve since learned healthier strategies. It’s not about spending nothing, it’s about targeting your spending on things you genuinely want. Here I’ll share my tips on how to curb your enthusiasm for “Buy now”.

View image in fullscreen Add items to a ‘save for later’ basket for a more responsible buying buzz. Photograph: Sean Gladwell/Getty Images

Control your impulse clicks

Online shopping is a marvel of convenience and a financial death trap. Just as the advent of remote shopping triggered a spending binge for me, the pandemic sparked an online shopping frenzy that has never really ended, with online retail spending continuing to reach record highs. Good news for the economy, perhaps, but bad news for your pocket and arguably your mental health.

If you find it hard to say “no” when gazing at a product page – any product page – switch it for “maybe”. Bookmark that tempting item in a “might buy” folder, save it to a wishlist or use Amazon’s “Save for later” button. I’ve found that the “maybe” often turns to “no” in the end, or at least to an “I can’t be bothered”, which saves just as much money.

Making shopping lists helps you buy less, not more, in my experience. It focuses your mind on the things you need and want, and reveals in black and white how much you’re set to spend before you spend it. Adding an item to “Save for later” or to a shopping list, whether on paper or via a site such as WishList, is a sort of placebo buying buzz. It’s less immediately visceral than the high you get from clicking “Buy now”, but without the comedown realisation that you’ve just spent money on another superfluous thing.

Set time and budget limits

If you find yourself straying helplessly to certain sites for regular hits of retail therapy, set time and date limits. Compartmentalise your itch. Some former shopping addicts on Reddit advise setting one day a month to shop on trigger websites such as Asos and Amazon. My fear with this strategy is that you’d try to squeeze as much shopping as possible into your allotted time, so I recommend setting a budget, too, and limiting the number of items you can buy.

Birthdays and Christmas can trigger buying binges in the irresistible guise of generosity, so set a budget and stick to it. Your recipient won’t love you more if you buy them a 12th, 13th or 14th present. If you enjoy buying presents, good for you – but buy them occasionally and mindfully all year round, and keep track of what you’ve bought.

Curate your newsletters

Retailer newsletters and social media are effective marketing tools, luring you in with the promise (and flattery) of exclusive super-fan discounts. That craft beer newsletter about time-limited free delivery for new releases just got you to spend £50 while you were bored at 3pm on a Tuesday. If you can afford it and it gives you joy, then great – but if you suspect it’s becoming a habit and you want to spend less, that newsletter subscription is best cancelled.

Buying secondhand is still buying

View image in fullscreen Use the ‘one in, one out’ rule: every time you buy a new item, sell or donate an old one. Photograph: elenaleonova/Getty Images

Sales and preloved platforms such as Vinted also feel exempt from the usual rules, because you’re saving money – right? Well, no, you’re spending it. Black Friday and other marketing feast days are spendthrift catnip, and retailers depend on you to spend, spend, spend. And as with discounts, secondhand can be a fantastic source of quality items that’d otherwise cost a fortune, but if you’re vulnerable to impulse overbuying, they’re still best avoided.

Buy quality, not quantity

Don’t let us put you off discount sales completely. Done right, they’re among our favourite things. If you’re after a particular high-quality item that you’ve coveted at full price and have budgeted for, a sale is an excellent opportunity to buy it – and there’s every chance you’ll use it and love it for years. It could be a timeless coat, a device you’ll use every day or a piece of furniture you’ll use for ever. Having a beloved investment piece cleaned, mended and maintained is much more satisfying than the temporary thrill of buying a new thing.

Ditch fast fashion

View image in fullscreen Fast fashion creates mountains of waste. Photograph: Roman Bulatov/Getty Images

Clothes are an especially powerful illustration of the value of quality over quantity. One investment piece may cost the same as 300 T-shirts from a high-street store, but the ethical and environmental cost could be much lower – and not only because you’re buying fewer items. Fast fashion is a grotesquely unethical business, and educating yourself about it is a powerful way to kill the habit. Its manufacture creates mountains of waste and pollution and contravenes human rights, and the throwaway habit it encourages creates another waste mountain – most of which is landfill.

If that’s not enough to curb your impulse buying, think about the packaging your purchases entail. The “free returns” model of online fashion generates billions of plastic bags and haulage miles, but clothes are far from the only offenders. The packaging I saw (usually while struggling under a pile of it) when reviewing the best mattresses astounded me, and it seemed so needless. Even if you order a small bottle of perfume, it’ll come encased in its own inflated plastic spacesuit that can’t be recycled. Head to a shop if you hanker after something you can buy locally. Not only will you be supporting local businesses, but you’ll use less packaging and can see or try it out in person. You may decide you don’t really fancy it after all.

Buy for the real you

However great the quality of the thing you’re buying, it’s still wasted money if you buy it for the wrong reasons. Buying for the person you wish you were (“I WILL diet into this”; “I can’t afford it but …”), to impress others (“he said he likes women in heels”) and Fomo (“what if I miss out on a bargain?”) are as responsible for just as many unwanted purchases as the dopamine rush of impulse buying.

Buy for the person you are, the body you have, the taste you have and the life you live. I’ve found this easier as I’ve grown older, not least because I know myself better and have less need to please other people. Ageing does present its own shopping challenges (changing shape, for example), but don’t feel pressed to buy a whole new wardrobe to suit your age. If you love an item and it fits you, it’s not “too young” for you. Bonus points if you’ve had it for decades.

Fast fashion is often made for very young and thin wearers. If the Primark dressing room mirror fills you with self-loathing because the “medium” jeans won’t do up, it’s not you, it’s them. If you have lost weight and you’re happy about it, then go ahead and buy for your new shape, but don’t turn your purchase into a stick to beat yourself with when you gain a few pounds.

Rediscover what you’ve already got

View image in fullscreen Invest in a sewing machine to keep your clothes going for years. Photograph: Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images

My indiscriminate spending phase turned my home into a mini landfill. It’s taken years of charity donations, eBaying and a small, carefully organised “keep” pile to restore the sense that I own it rather than it owning me. Even if you haven’t amassed your own personal junkyard, systematically going through your stuff can have a big positive impact on your mood and spending habits.

You don’t have to go to Kondo extremes. Just tidy your stuff to remember what you already have. This is especially true for the things you love buying – books, clothes, shoes, accessories, kitchenware, kit for hobbies or whatever – because they trigger the biggest impulse-buying buzz, even though you already have so much of it. Going through it, you’ll have moments of absolute delight (for free!) when you come across beloved items that got buried and forgotten.

Sorting your clothes is also a useful reminder that your judgment isn’t at its best when you’re impulse buying. Are you ever going to wear those wide-leg PVC trousers that wouldn’t look good on a Hadid sister, let alone (no offence) you? Get rid. Donate to charity, have a clothes swap session with friends, or at least sell on eBay or Vinted. Charities including the British Heart Foundation and Oxfam pay postage for your donation parcel. If you want to be really strict, set yourself a “one in, one out” rule: every time you buy a new item, sell or donate an old one.

Just don’t get too attached to a donate/sell habit. It may encourage you to buy stuff while kidding yourself that “I can always sell it”. Better to treat each purchase as a forever buy. Here’s a pass for an additional buy, though: get a sewing machine, and you’ll be able to keep your clothes fresh and well-fitting for years.

Jane Hoskyn is a freelance journalist who’s spent more than 30 years writing about, and often failing to resist, the consumer temptations of the internet.

From Scandi brands to plastic-free fabrics: 10 women’s raincoats to style out drizzly days,['Ellie Violet Bramley'],2025-02-26,"We’ve all heard the adage, “There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes.” I’ve always felt this obfuscates the fact that winter can be tough precisely because of its soggy, grey – yes, “bad” – weather, even if you’re dressed head to toe in warm waterproofs. However, I now have to admit that the right clothes for the right weather can bring a freedom. Enter: the humble anorak.

The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.

I spent my 20s dreading winters, which I spent freezing, only thawing out come summer. Even then, a light July sprinkling might have stopped me in my tracks, so opposed was I to clothes that made concessions for meteorological conditions. But with adulthood came an admission that anoraks are low-key amazing. I bought one and – by keeping me dry and therefore warmer – it has, without hyperbole, changed my life.

But not all anoraks are created equal. Some are designed for the kind of conditions you might meet on an Icelandic fishing trawler, while others barely stand up to a summer drizzle. Some don’t seem to consider aesthetics at all, but others can keep their wearer dry without making them look as if they’re going on a log flume.

I’m now the proud owner of two anoraks, and often mix and match with my partner’s, depending on the occasion and type of rain with which I’m faced. Sometimes, I’ll wear an oversized raincoat over my smarter wool coat, and shed a layer as I reach my destination. Other times I wear one over a Uniqlo puffer jacket – a vital winter layer, in my book – and cycle, without feeling weighed down by wool and sweat.

The best women’s raincoats for 2025

View image in fullscreen Photograph: Zorica Nastasic/Getty Images

Best all-rounder:

Rains long jacket

£95 at Rains

£78 at John Lewis

When it comes to wet-weather gear, Scandinavian brand Rains knows what it’s doing (the clue is in the name). This is one of the brands I reach for whenever the weather takes a turn; its long jacket has seen me through countless soggy commutes, playground trips and walks in the woods. After a muddy walk, it’s happily machine-washable – despite having been washed several times over the years, mine is still going strong (use a guppy bag when washing to help prevent the shedding of microfibres into the waterways). I’m a fan of the unisex cut, but if you prefer something a bit more sculpted, then an anorak with an A-line silhouette may be preferable.

It also comes in a shorter style, but I find the longer length more practical. Having said that, I often find myself with sodden legs, as rain seems to be expelled from the anorak and drip violently down on to my knees. Maybe next winter I’ll go for one of its waterproof all-in-ones. A cape – particularly in tinfoil silver – is tempting for cycling.

Best for a minimal look:

Uniqlo Blocktech parka

£59.90 at Uniqlo

If you prefer your raincoat to be minimal – melting into the background rather than bringing main-character energy – then this parka may be for you. It looks like something Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy might have worn on the streets of Manhattan in the 90s, which is no bad thing. Available in black, beige, khaki and blue, the black and beige in particular channel low-key cool. Be warned, though, that this coat won’t stand up to more than a shower: opt for something less Kennedy-chic if you’re expecting heavy rain.

Best for torrential rain:

Stutterheim Stockholm raincoat

From £125 at Stutterheim

My partner has one of these sturdy garments from the Stockholm-based brand Stutterheim. The texture of the fabric is less like a traditional anorak and more like the tough skin of a dogfish – more hardy than any other waterproof I’ve come across. It somehow still manages to look desirable, thanks to the Scandi design sensibilities that have gone into it. As the label reads: “Swedish melancholy at its driest.”

Despite the underarm eyelets, it won’t be the best for strenuous activity – the heavy material would make an uphill cycle hot and sweaty work. There is a more lightweight version, which is less fit for the Atlantic and more apt for spring. There are a rare few colours here, such as peach, that fall outside the usual black, blue, khaki and yellow – and several colours currently have between 30% and 50% off, which is welcome on the cost of a £250 jacket.

Best value for money:

Mac in a Sac Origin packable waterproof jacket

£37.50 at Mac in a Sac

£37.50 at John Lewis

Mac in a sac, cag in a bag – whatever you want to call it, this pack-it-down-tight-and-pop-it-in-your-schoolbag anorak will be well known to any child of the 90s. Decades later and it’s still going strong – as close to an icon as you can get in the wet-weather space – the Spice Girls of anoraks.

It’s also reasonably priced, weighs about the same as a punnet of strawberries and comes in an array of colours – neon blue, pink, orange, yellow and green; pink, soft orange and violet; classic black, navy and charcoal. The elasticated cuffs will help keep out rain, as will the adjustable hood, which can be pulled tight over your head for that particularly grim sideways kind of rain.

Best fashion-forward style:

Regatta Bayletta waterproof jacket

From £23.95 at Regatta

From £27.49 at Decathlon

There was a time when the words anorak and fashion wouldn’t be found dead in a sentence together, but times have changed. As ever, the dial has been pushed by one Mrs Prada, who sent a very Duke of Edinburgh-looking yellow raincoat down her spring/summer 2025 catwalk. The key is what you wear it with, however, so pair it with a cocktail dress – and definitely opt for the yellow – if you want to be true to Miuccia’s intentions.

If you’re just after a bit of style over your old jeans and a sweatshirt, this green raincoat from Ganni may be more your speed. Or this classic Barbour waterproof trenchcoat, which is inspired by men’s tailoring but has a drawcord at the waist so that you can cinch it in or not depending on your mood. It’s not cheap, but the ubiquity of vintage Barbour jackets in good condition speaks to their hard-wearing nature. Could this be the raincoat to keep you dry in style for years to come?

Best for the office:

Community Clothing Frances raincoat

£199 at Community Clothing

If it’s a rainy day but you still need to look professional, Community Clothing’s belted raglan raincoat is the one for you. It doesn’t look out of place heading through the swivel doors of an office. Made from British Millerain (waxed) cotton, with a viscose lining, this coat is cut and sewn in Blackburn: with 137 rainy days a year, the town knows its way around a downpour. And while it’s probably no match for the heaviest rain, team it with a brolley and it should keep you dry on an otherwise soggy commute. It’s not cheap, but it’s well-made – and comes in smart black, navy and olive green.

Best for durability:

Patagonia Boulder Fork rain jacket

From £150 at Patagonia

£150 at Cotswold Outdoor

Outdoor gear specialist Patagonia offers DIY repair guides and a repair service via its website. Its Boulder Fork rain jacket isn’t cheap, but it’s built to be durable – and several of the colours are now on sale.

It’s eminently practical. The hood comes with a laminated visor, which sounds extreme, but I can see it being useful up a mountain – or at the bus stop. In fact, there are lots of clever design features on this jacket, such as a front pocket complete with a watertight zipper – perfect for your phone or bus pass. Patagonia is well regarded for its ethics, too.

Best for ‘a chance of showers’:

Muji water‐repellent hooded coat

£63.95 at Muji

If you’re after protection from torrential rain, then look away now. This sleek, chic “water-repellent” hooded coat from Muji is an easy, pragmatic layer for days when it might rain, and you don’t want to wear a full-on anorak. Simple and stylish, this would work just as well for work as it would on the weekend – plus, it’s minimal enough design-wise that it won’t clash with almost any outfit. For a practical layer that feels likely to enter your outerwear rotation beyond rainy days, this coat feels like good value.

Best to stash in your bag:

Finisterre Rainbird waterproof jacket

£135 at Finisterre

This lightweight waterproof jacket weighs just 300g and packs down small – perfect to ram into your bag just in case. This is advertised as a men’s jacket, but there’s something about the cut of some women’s anoraks that I find a bit old-fashioned. Size up in a men’s cut and this should fit over whatever else you have on as an extra waterproof layer. Some colours are on offer – although with several sizes sold out or low in stock, act fast if you want to nab one.

Best sustainable option:

Rapanui Raindrift raincoat

£75 at Rapanui

While most raincoats are made from some kind of plastic, this organic cotton, plastic-free option is worth considering. It might not cut it in driving winter rain, but it could hold its own against a spring shower. It’s coated with a PFC-free, water-resistant layer and comes in lavender grey and stone. The boxy cut should fit a chunky jumper underneath it, too."
Bouldering equipment for beginners: the gear you need to crush it at the climbing wall – and the stuff you don’t,['Tom Bruce'],2025-02-25,"Bouldering and climbing have become hugely popular. What was once a niche hobby is now an Olympic sport, and with bouldering gyms popping up across the UK, it’s an exciting time to join the climbing community.

The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.

Various weird and wonderful products that promise to up your climbing game are now available, but which ones do you need? As an avid climber who’s tried countless training tools over the past eight years, I have a good idea of what works and what doesn’t – because I’ve spent a lot of money finding out the hard way.

But first I need to tackle the subject of climbing footwear: if there’s one thing you can’t go bouldering without, it’s a decent pair of climbing shoes.

The best climbing shoes to wear bouldering

View image in fullscreen Buying your own climbing shoes may save you money if you’re renting them regularly. Photograph: takoburito/Getty Images/iStockphoto

I’ve owned plenty of climbing shoes over the years, but I sought help from an expert here: Imi Bagnall-Smith is a professional route setter and coach at Catalyst Climbing, a London-based team offering coaching for all levels. Climbing shoes can vary widely, and I’ve not tried on nearly as many as Bagnall-Smith. Crucially, through working with her clients, she has been able to see the types of shoes that work best for new climbers.

Budget climbing shoe:

Simond Klimb unisex

£54.99 at Decathlon

Climbing shoes aren’t cheap. “Nowadays, very few – if any – of the specialist climbing brands offer shoes for less than £100,” says Bagnall-Smith. “For a low-budget first pair of shoes, I’d look to Decathlon’s Simond.”

I’ve owned a pair of Simonds for years, so I have to agree. At only £55, the Simond climbing shoe lacks the premium features of pricier options, such as elasticised tension systems or specialised rubber for heel and toe hooking, but it’s still a good starting point. It’s comfortable and easy to adjust, with soles coated in industry-standard XS Grip rubber to keep your feet secure on the wall.

If you’re a beginner, though, renting shoes is a good starting point. “Most people will do this for a month or two,” says Bagnall-Smith. “However, once you start climbing more regularly, it can be nicer to have your own pair of shoes that fit your foot shape well, and have only been worn by your feet.”

Buying a pair is particularly worth it once you start climbing regularly, because you know you’ll save money in the long run (renting shoes is £4 a go at my gym).

Mid-priced climbing shoe:

La Sportiva Tarantula Boulder

Men’s

£99 at La Sportiva

£99 at Go Outdoors

Women’s

£99 at La Sportiva

£90 at Cotswold Outdoor

“If you can afford it, a beginner model from renowned climbing brands Scarpa or La Sportiva would be a great investment,” says Bagnall-Smith. The La Sportiva Tarantula Boulder, for example, has been designed with beginner boulderers in mind, featuring a neutral shape to fit all foot types.

After something cheaper? Bagnall-Smith recommends the Scarpa Reflex VS (£85): “A flat, beginner-oriented model with two Velcro straps for better fit adjustment. The rubber is sticky but durable, and they will help you transition from rentals to your own shoes.

“I’d recommend trying them on and choosing whichever fits best. While climbing shoes aren’t always comfortable, a better fit makes a huge difference.”

Premium climbing shoe:

Scarpa Veloce

Men’s

£140 at Go Outdoors

Women’s

£140 at Go Outdoors

Looking for the ultimate beginner climbing shoe? These are the ones, according to Bagnall-Smith. “Whenever I’m recommending climbing shoes to a newer indoor climber, there’s one pair I pick every time: the Scarpa Veloce,” she says. “At £140, they’re slightly more expensive than other beginner shoes, but the quality is high. They make standing on indoor holds and structures feel more secure.”

Bagnall-Smith describes them as “almost like a sticky, squishy, rubber sock, with the grippiest rubber of any beginner model I’ve tried.” And because of the soft S72 rubber, they’re more comfortable than other shoes at this price. “They don’t cause the same pressure points or dig in very much, so I find it much easier to wear them for a whole session,” she says. These shoes are also vegan-friendly, ideal for those wanting to avoid animal-based materials and glues.

Essential bouldering equipment

View image in fullscreen Applying chalk can help build your confidence. Photograph: Trevor Williams/Getty Images

Climbing chalk:

Moon Dust loose chalk

£8 for 300g at Tiso

Most climbers will “chalk up” before every boulder. The main purpose is to increase the friction between your skin and the climbing holds through sweat absorption, though you could argue the psychological boost is equally important. Before trying a boulder that’s at my physical limit, I want to do everything I can to improve my chances. The careful application of chalk builds my confidence and makes me push that much harder on an attempt. Call it a placebo, but it works for me – and for everyone else I climb with.

Moon Dust is a mid-priced chalk, but it more than holds its own against pricier versions. I’ve tried many chalk brands over the years, and find the grittier texture of Moon Dust helps it to stay on my hands that bit longer. Compared with finer-powder chalks, it’s less prone to exploding all over the gym like a smoke grenade when you accidentally kick over your chalk bag.

Chalk bag:

Organic Climbing lunch bag

£38.50 at Ellis Brigham

While nothing is stopping you from dipping your hands straight into the chalk packet as you make your way around the gym, a chalk bag – or boulder bucket – is a much more elegant solution. The lunch bag from Organic Climbing is a popular choice due to its modest price, sturdy construction and fetching patterns, the latter being unique to each bag. It has everything you need from a bouldering bucket, with a Velcro seal, two elastic brush holders and a zippered back pocket to store your phone and keys. Oh, and it holds loads of chalk, which is fairly important.

Hold brush:

Metolius M-16 brush

£4.94 at SportsShoes

Over time, chalk and burned shoe rubber build up on the holds of the gym wall, reducing that all-important friction between you and the plastic. Giving them a quick clean with a good brush can make all the difference when tackling a tricky boulder, especially if it’s a popular (and therefore dirtier) climb.

The M-16 was originally designed as a maintenance tool for assault rifles, but it also turns out to be effective at cleaning climbing holds – a much better use for a brush. The brush’s large end is better for dusting off small to medium climbing holds, while the smaller brush works well for scrubbing tiny crimps and foot edges.

Finger tape:

Beta tape 2.5cm x 10m

£6 at Tiso

Finger tape is primarily used for support after an injury, but it has many other uses when climbing. It’s common practice to wrap tape over any cuts and blisters, for example, because a plaster won’t stay in place when pulling on holds. Crack climbers use this kind of tape to cover their entire hands, almost like a glove, although this specialist type of climbing is rarely replicated in gyms.

Bouldering pad:

Organic Climbing Simple pad

£230 at Blacks

£250 at Go Outdoors

Ready for real rock in the great outdoors? Then you’ll need something to land on that’s not the ground. There’s no golden rule for buying a crash pad; they vary, and every climber has their preference. Some bouldering pads are wider than others, some have denser foam – some even have little carpets for wiping muck off your shoes. Ultimately, any will be better than no pad at all. If you don’t know where to start and want something reliable, you can’t go wrong with the Organic Climbing Simple pad. It looks pretty, folds in half to transport, and it’s built to last.

Moisture absorbers:

SmellWell freshener inserts

£9.95 at Vibram

Climbing shoes are inherently disgusting. When you take them off after a long session on the wall, you leave behind a potent brew of sweat and skin that will fester for days unless you take immediate corrective action. The first step is to limit bacterial growth by drying out the shoes with a moisture absorber. SmellWell’s freshener inserts are just the right size to pop inside your climbing shoes. By the time you get home, they should have soaked up the worst of the damage, drying out your shoes and suffusing them with a pleasing natural scent.

Shoe fresheners:

Boot Bananas

£15 at Go Outdoors

£16.50 at Amazon

Once your shoes are almost dry, it’s time to pop in a pair of Boot Bananas. These brightly coloured shoe fresheners carry an invigorating lavender fragrance that overpowers all but the most heinous of foot odours. They also have antimicrobial properties that can keep bacteria at bay, prolonging your shoes’ lifespan.

The outer fabric and inner charcoal act as additional moisture absorbers, but the effect is limited, so don’t rely on this alone. Dry out the shoes first, either with the moisture absorbers above or a hairdryer. You’ll know when your Boot Bananas need to be replaced because they slowly turn brown – or “ripen” – over time. It’s an intentional feature – nothing to be worried about.

Shoe cleaner:

Shoe Chalk

£4.32 at Banana Fingers

Cleaning climbing shoes is a controversial topic. Naturally, you don’t want to wreck their structural integrity by leaving them to soak in a bucket or – even worse – throwing them in the wash. Shoe chalk has been designed specifically to clean out the inside of climbing shoes, flushing out the grime while leaving the outer materials untouched.

Climbing training aids

View image in fullscreen Bands are ideal for warming up.

Resistance bands:

Lattice Training resistance bands

£12.50 for five at Lattice Training

Bands are versatile training tools, allowing you to perform effective non-impact warmups to prevent injuries while improving your strength and mobility. Bands can also be used to bridge the gap if you can’t yet perform pull-ups; looped around the bar and your feet, the band offsets your body weight so that you can gradually build enough strength to perform the exercise unassisted.

Yoga mat:

Lattice Training flex mat

£55 at Lattice Training

As you ascend the grades, flexibility becomes increasingly important. Lattice Training’s flex yoga mat is designed for climbers. Its laser-etched scales and angle markers let you measure your body’s exact limitations in various poses, so you can easily track progress. The non-slip cork surface and rubber base are major plus points.

Finger strength training:

Beastmaker 1000 Series

£95 at Beastmaker

£87 at Amazon

Sooner or later you’ll hit a plateau that sees you “stuck” at a certain grade for longer than you’d like. This may be the moment to start climbing-specific finger training, AKA hangboarding. Do you need to hangboard? No. But it’s the best-known way to consistently and progressively train your finger strength on small edges while avoiding injury.

The Beastmaker 1000 Series is one of the more accessible hangboards because of the two large handles on the top row. Set at shoulder width, they’re ideal for practising pull-ups, lock-offs and one-arm hangs before getting to grips with the smaller edges on the board. Beastmaker has an accompanying book and app, so you can follow along with the programme to incrementally increase the difficulty of your routine.

Extensor bands:

The Hand Band

£12.99 at Amazon

Although climbing relies heavily on the forearm’s flexor muscles, the extensor muscles play an important part in your overall grip strength. The stronger your extensors are, the better supported your fingers are while climbing. That’s where a set of extensor bands comes in. The beauty of these is that you can use them anywhere; stick some in your pocket and take them out whenever you’re bored.

Don’t bother with …

High-resistance grip trainers

The closed-hand strength that these grippers help to build isn’t that transferable to climbing, where open-hand grip strength is king. A handheld grip trainer routine won’t improve your climbing, with the possible exception of pulling on pinch holds. This is a lesson I learned the hard way. That said, some climbers find low-resistance grippers useful for warming up their fingers.

Extremely undersized climbing shoes

Some climbers believe that, for optimum performance, you need shoes so small that they’re actually painful to wear. It’s bad advice. “Climbing shoes are designed to be worn with a fairly tight fit that hugs the feet closely, so you may have to downsize from your street shoe size (usually 1-2 EU sizes),” says Bagnall-Smith. But that doesn’t mean downsizing to the point where you’re in pain and feeling the need to take them off after every single boulder. You just want to make sure that your feet aren’t sliding around, and that the shoes hold firm when performing high-tension manoeuvres, such as smearing and heel-hooking.

Bagnall-Smith also recommends going in person to try on as many shoes as possible. “Usually the staff can give helpful guidance on sizing, and foot shape can play a huge role in how shoes fit,” she says. “Sometimes you might need to try on a few before you find one that fits just right.”

On a personal note, I once watched a man spend two minutes putting on a single shoe at the gym. The grunts of pain and bulging neck veins were something to behold. Frankly, if the act of pulling on your shoes is more strenuous than the boulders you climb once they’re on, you may need bigger shoes.

Ankle weights, wrist weights and weighted vests

Adding weight to your body will obviously make it more difficult to pull yourself up the wall. In theory, this will result in greater strength gains and better climbing. In reality, however, adding weights may actively prevent you from improving your technique on the wall while also increasing the risk of injury, especially if you’re really piling on the kilos.

Instead of adding weight to make climbing harder, you should focus on efficient body movement to make climbing easier. The exception is in off-the-wall training, where adding weights to a vest or harness when doing pull-ups or max-limit hangs can be advantageous."
"‘It could get an orgasm out of a cabbage’: the best vibrators, tested",['Alix Fox'],2025-02-23,"I could write here about how almost a fifth of women surveyed by Durex said using a sex toy was the most dependable way for them to climax. Or I could point out how Kinsey Institute research suggests regular masturbation can help relieve and prevent symptoms of menopause, such as vaginal atrophy.

I’m a multi-award-winning writer, broadcaster and educator with more than two decades of experience specialising in sexual wellbeing and culture. I’ve worked as an expert independent research and development consultant for more than a dozen adult product companies; I’m a board member of the Vagina Museum in London; I’m a campaigner for sexual health and gynaecological charities, including Terrence Higgins Trust and the Eve Appeal; and I helped write many of your favourite characters’ lines about dildos, douching and desire in the hit Netflix series Sex Education. All this means I’m well qualified to assess whether these devices have been crafted decently.

I’m also a freelancer who works from home. I’ll leave it at that.

Types of vibrator

View image in fullscreen The Satisfyer Air Pump Bunny 1.

Asking, “What’s the best sex toy?” is a bit like asking, “What’s the best tool?”: a plethora exists, and selecting the most suitable one is influenced by what you want it to do. Here, I’ve examined three popular styles of vibrators.

Bullets

Small, versatile vibrators for external use only. They’re primarily designed for targeted clitoral stimulation but can be used to tickle nipples, glide up the insides of thighs, or take on a tour practically anywhere on the body (except inside the anus – that’s not safe).

Wands

Large vibrators with broad heads, again for external use only. Wands deliver the most powerful vibrations over a wide area – this sector is where you’ll find the most bone-shaking master blasters on the market. Fantastic for people who need intense stimulation, and good for deep body massage, too.

Rabbits

These vibrators have two parts: an insertable shaft, designed to stimulate inside the vaginal canal and excite the G-spot, and an external head that stimulates the clitoris. This “dual stimulation” is intended to provoke a “blended orgasm”: a climax induced by mixing multiple forms of simultaneously delivered sensation.

The best bullet vibrators

Best bullet vibrator overall:

We-Vibe Tango X

£79 at We-Vibe

£79.99 at Sinful

The original Tango came out about 15 years ago, and it’s consistently remained so high up in expert rankings that by this stage it might have altitude sickness.

Why we love it

Its Goat status is justified: while many bullets offer “buzzy”, high-frequency vibrations that don’t travel far into the body, the Tango is satisfyingly “rumbly” for its size, providing additional lower-frequency stimulation that carries deeper into tissues and awakens more nerve endings. It packs a lot of oomph into its small size.

This latest incarnation features a silicone grip to make it less slippery to hold, while the business end remains hard and glossy. There’s nothing to muffle the vibrations: they’re full-on and focused, which is exactly what tickles many people’s pickles. Others may find the feeling too “sharp”, however.

Three separate buttons to increase/decrease power and change pulse patterns make it easy to find the exact output to suit you. There’s excellent variety between the settings, the lowest of which is more a brisk twitch than a vibration. Plus, a travel lock means you won’t have to trot out the “it must be my electric toothbrush!” line when your handbag starts humming.

It’s a shame that … the magnetic charger can be accidentally knocked off its connections, but it’s more hygienic than a lead that needs to plug into a hole in the toy.

Charge time: one hour and 30 minutes

Waterproof: yes

Best bullet for innovation:

Hot Octopuss AMO

£49.95 at Hot Octopuss

£49.95 at Amazon

Another tiny yet mighty toy that, given its petite dimensions, is a powerful rumbler. Hot Octopuss is a skilled inventor: its suite of ingenious toys includes Pulse – the world’s first “Guybrator” that can induce orgasms from a flaccid penis as well as an erect one, proving a boon for cancer survivors, disabled people and others with erectile difficulties.

Why we love it

AMO’s ingenuity is in the way it’s sculpted, with a pointy tip for pinpoint pleasure; a broader head on the opposite side for more diffuse vibrations; and a fin-like profile for nestling lengthways between labia. It’s made of silky silicone, which – unlike tougher plastics – won’t hurt or slide around if you press down on it to apply extra pressure.

It’s a shame that … the battery life isn’t better, and the payoff of the inventive contours is that the AMO can’t be inserted into strap-ons, dildos or other toys that rely on a standard-shape bullet.

Speeds: six

Vibe patterns: five

Power: rechargeable

Run time: 40 minutes

Charge time: two to three hours

Waterproof: yes

Warranty: one year

Best sustainable bullet:

Love Not War Maya

£89.99 at Love Not War

£89.99 at Veo

If you want to feel the earth move without harming the planet, Love Not War is your friend with benefits. Its Maya bullet is made from recycled aluminium in a hydroelectric-powered factory, and minimally packaged in a brown cardboard box printed with soy ink.



Why we love it

Seven different screw-on heads are sold separately to convert the bullet into, say, a mini wand or G-spot probe. Interchangeable efforts I’ve tried in the past have suffered from insufficiently strong motors, so they haven’t been able to successfully transmit vibrations throughout each attachment, especially longer/larger ones. Love Not War is mounting an admirable battle against that challenge, however.

It’s a shame that … at £45 a pop, amassing a collection of heads will cost you a pretty penny – although the brand will plant a tree for each one sold.

Speeds: four

Vibe patterns: seven

Power: rechargeable

Run time: one hour

Charge time: two hours

Waterproof: yes

Warranty: Love Not War will repair toys to keep them alive for as long as possible

Best soft and sensual option:

Smile Makers The Firefighter

£44.95 at Boots

£49.95 at Beauty Bay

Bullets are often designed to treat the genitals like a game of darts: if the clitoris is the bullseye, they aim to hit it dead on. The Firefighter instead approaches stimulation more like a curling match: gently brushing, sweeping and edging towards a climax.

Why we love it

The fluttering, flickering flame-shaped head will suit those who prefer a slow, delicate buildup before switching to the more traditional, targeted “pointy finger” part of the toy.

It’s a shame that … it only comes in pink. The Surfer, another Smile Makers bullet, is a refreshingly unusual zesty orange.

Speeds: four

Vibe patterns: two

Power: rechargeable

Run time: three hours

Charge time: two to two-and-a-half hours

Waterproof: yes

Warranty: two years

Best budget bullet:

The Rocks Off RO-90

£10.99 at Rocks Off

£9.95 at Amazon

Rocks Off makes a whole shooting range of cheap-and-cheerful battery-powered bullets. Take your pick of pointed, rounded, angled or lipstick-shaped tip; select a slick gloss, powdery matt or silicone finish; and choose from more colours than the fabric of Joseph’s Dreamcoat, including one that changes from purple to pink in response to body heat.

Why we love it

It’s a fair amount of bang for very few bucks. I singled out the RO-90 as my best budget buy because the AAA battery it takes is much easier to source than the N-size variety inside the smaller RO-80 model. The slightly longer shaft makes it better suited to use for penetrative play, too, if that’s your bag.

Hats off to Rocks Off as well for its four-year collaboration with disability charity Enhance The UK to develop a truly accessible toy range, Quest. A 5% share of sales from that collection goes back to the charity.

It’s a shame that … single-button controls mean you have to cycle all the way through speeds/pulses to change them. I also question how the shiny metallic finishes might stand up to long-term cleaning.

Speeds: three

The best rabbit vibrators

Best rabbit vibrator overall:

Je Joue Hera Flex

£87.20 at Je Joue

£109 at Superdrug

The Hera Flex is such a good problem-solver, it could probably win an algebra contest. Since everyone’s anatomy is different and distances between vaginas and clitorises vary, a frequent dilemma with rabbits is that once the shaft is inserted, the external stimulator doesn’t quite rest on the right spot. Many toys are too rigid to allow sufficient bending and angle adjustment to solve this issue.

Why we love it

This Je Joue genius solves that: it’s as flexible as a yoga master and both parts of it are poseable, allowing you to easily customise how it curves to fit your bits. Another irritating rabbit habit is that the “ears” intended to tickle either side of the clitoris can pinch, poke or catch against sensitive flesh, depending on how your body happens to be built. Here, the Hera is a hero once more, replacing the traditional bunny head with a plush, spongy, smooth “thumb”. If you’re someone with a more frilly clitoral hood or labia that gets painfully pulled by rabbit ears, this could be a real thumbs up. A quality, thoughtfully re-engineered rabbit reboot.

It’s a shame that … there’s a bit of a jump between the first two power levels. A steadier climb would be preferable. The squishiness of the Hera Flex won’t suit folks who prefer firmer pressure on their hotspots, either. But as so often in the world of sex toys, that’s rather like saying, “people who prefer raspberries shouldn’t choose this banana”; it’s a question of taste, rather than a product being bad.

Speeds: five

Vibe patterns: seven

Power: rechargeable

Run time: one hour

Charge time: one hour and 30 minutes

Best for temperature titillation:

Lovehoney Glow Bunny

£79.99 at Lovehoney

If you just want to use this toy as an old-school rabbit, it’s a solid choice … but it also has new-fangled tricks up its sleeve.

Why we love it

The temperature-play plate on the top of the shaft heats to 38C in less than two minutes, feeling almost like a warm tongue, and swiftly cools to 18C, giving a whole new meaning to “Netflix and chill”. I imagine the cold setting could be particularly enticing during sweltering summer nights, and it works nicely for nipple play, too.

It’s a shame that … the power is perfectly acceptable, but not perfect for the power-hungry.

Speeds: three

Vibe patterns: four

Power: rechargeable

Run time: one hour

Charge time: three hours

Waterproof: yes

Warranty: 100 days

Best for air pulse stimulation:

Womanizer Duo 2

£189 at Womanizer

£189 at Boots

Admittedly, this looks more like something Star Trek’s Captain Picard should be at the helm of than a conventional rabbit. Rather than stimulating the clitoris with vibrations, the Duo 2 uses pulses of air to create a throbbing, sucking effect. Womanizer was the first to introduce this technology to the adult market in 2014, when it represented one of the most groundbreaking innovations in years.

Why we love it

The firm continues to be a pioneer. This toy boasts multiple proprietary features, including “Smart Silence”: it will only turn on when in contact with skin. This means the battery life is preserved and you don’t have to fumble to switch it off in a panic if your intimacy is interrupted.

An Autopilot mode alternates between surprise pulse patterns and intensities to prevent masturbation from becoming predictable, while the Afterglow setting helps you gradually wind down post-climax, rather than simply switching off.

It’s a shame that … the shape takes getting used to, and there are now more intuitive (and affordable) suction and vibration rabbit toys available. That said, I believe the Duo 2 is worth mastering due to its god-tier-level exclusive features.

Speeds: 14

Vibe patterns: 10

Power: rechargeable

Run time: two hours

Charge time: two hours

Waterproof: yes

Warranty: five years

Best for an innovative shaft:

Satisfyer Air Pump Bunny 1

£58.95 at Satisfyer

£39.97 at Amazon

Satisfyer is known for two things. First, making excellent-quality, more affordable “dupes” of aspirational high-end sex toys – almost like an Aldi version of Lelo and co. Second, and in contrast to the first, rolling out vast multitudes of its own novel inventions, including this Air Pump Bunny.

Why we love it

It sports an inflatable shaft that can be enlarged by up to 15mm in diameter at the touch of a button, producing a “filling” sensation that some find mind-blowing. This could be just the ticket if your orgasm is intensified by the presence of a girthy internal toy, giving your vaginal muscles something to clench around as the waves of climax hit (more common than is discussed), especially if you need to build up to having something wide inside you. Magnetic charging, smart buttons and a walloping 15-year warranty show this toy is more than just hot air.

It’s a shame that … it makes a noise like a car tyre inflator while it’s pumping up, and sounds like your vagina is sighing mournfully as it deflates. Put the stereo on, because this toy’s noises make for an inappropriate and distressing lovemaking soundtrack.

Best sustainable rabbit:

Natural Love Company Senna

£94.95 at the Natural Love Company

In the past, eco-friendly toys have been well-intentioned yet disappointingly ineffectual, and with an unattractively hippy vibe. There was a wind-up vibrator that required eight minutes of hand-cranking and looked like something you’d find in an army medical tent, and a solar-powered bullet that had to stay attached to its charging panel to work. But now the Natural Love Company is making beautiful, talented toys, with eco credentials, including the incorporation of reclaimed ocean plastics and carbon-neutral delivery.

Why we love it

I was intrigued to check out the Senna after being impressed by the Yarrow: a willow-green rabbit with a thrusting head that’s far more graceful-looking than this kind of gadget has any right to be. The Senna’s undulating shaft mimics a “come hither” motion, with swirling beads beneath a buttery-soft silicone covering, while the rabbit ears have been swapped for a little pulsating bean. It’s another winner that’ll give your knees the hippy shakes.

It’s a shame that … the crevices around the clitoral stimulating nub need extra attention to keep clean and bacteria-free between uses.

Speeds: three

Vibe patterns: seven

Power: rechargeable

Run time: one hour

Charge time: two hours

Waterproof: yes

Best new animal:

Snail Vibe Curve

£119 at Sh!

£119.99 at Love Honey

A new animal enters the scene, with an ingenious take on how to tackle those pesky rabbit problems. Instead of bunny ears, the Snail Vibe Curve has a vibrating spiral “shell” that rests externally on the clitoris. As you insert the internal shaft, this shell unrolls to maintain constant clitoral contact – check out the videos on Snail Vibe’s website to see what I mean. You can enjoy penetration that’s as shallow or deep as you wish or thrust the toy back and forth, without the clitoral stimulator slipping out of place.

The Snail has received a glow-up for its Curve edition, with a ribbed texture applied to the shell; magnetic charging; and most usefully, the addition of a looped handle for easier handling. It has two pleasingly throbby motors on the shell and shaft, which can be independently controlled to fine-tune your experience, inside and out. It takes a while to find your way around a toy this curious, but the payoff is worthwhile.

It’s a shame that … the buttons are a fraction fiddly, and don’t think about trombones during use or you won’t be able to stop laughing.

Speeds: five for each motor

Vibe patterns: five for each motor

Best budget rabbit:

Bondara Screwball Mon Amour

£45.99 at Bondara

An aesthetic homage to the popular Lelo Soraya 2 that costs a quarter of the price. The Screwball looks like a far posher, better-bred rabbit than it is, and it performs eyebrow-raisingly well for the price point.

Why we love it

With separate motors driving the ears and shaft, it revs very respectably, and its controls can be locked for travel by pressing and holding the + and – buttons for three seconds. The hoop handle is intended for users to loop their fingers through, so their thumb rests naturally on the controls, but you could also thread silky bondage rope through it for … reasons.

It’s a shame that … Bondara recommends that the Screwball isn’t left plugged in for more than four hours, to avoid impairing the battery over time. That’s a pest if you want to charge overnight (or while you’re at work). I wonder if this drawback might be applicable to a bunch of rechargeable sex toys, however, and other brands just aren’t as diligent about warning us?

The best wand vibrators

Best wand vibrator overall:

Doxy Die Cast By You

£174.99 at Doxy

As they say: go hard, or go home. The mains-powered Doxy Die Cast is arguably as hard as you can go. It’s not for the faint of heart (or parts), but it’s so powerful that it can probably conjure up an orgasm through walls. And speaking of your hopefully thick walls, you don’t get 3,000-9,000 revs a minute of power without noise, so be aware this is loud enough to sound like you need a licence to drive it.

Why we love it

Doxy makes a rechargeable Die Cast (£164.99), and several superb smaller, lighter cordless wands, too. However, I’m recommending the plug-in version because its formidable power never stops. It has a three-metre lead, so it stretches most places you want it to go – if you’re already considering a toy the size of a rounders bat, portability probably isn’t a big concern. I’ve had a version for a decade and a half, and it’s still impeccable.

Nothing about the Die Cast is subtle, but I’d argue that the push for sex toys to be “discreet” has roots in shame. Multiple women who’ve sought my advice for anorgasmia have called me, ecstatic, after my Doxy tipoff has tipped them over into their first ever climax: something unabashed that works is better than something understated that doesn’t. Invest in the customisable By You edition, and get ready to rumble.

It’s a shame that … at 690g, it’s heavy as hell. People without strong wrists or with problems like arthritis should explore wand-positioning cushions, such as those by Liberator and Sportsheets.

Speeds: continuous progression

Vibe patterns: variable escalating pulse mode

Power: mains-powered

Waterproof: no

Warranty: two years

Best classy all-rounder:

Lelo Smart Wand 2

£107.40 at Lelo

From £113.39 at Amazon

Lelo is the Idris Elba of the adult toy arena: chic, almost universally considered attractive, and a reliably fantastic performer.

Why we love it

This ergonomic delight is easy to wield and functions excellently as a massage gun in addition to its racier applications. It’s elegant, intuitive to use and packs plenty of punch at the higher settings. It would have been my top pick were it not for the fact that I’m confident the Doxy could get an orgasm out of a cabbage.

It’s a shame that … the large Lelo wand will intimidate some folks: for some reason its curved rhino-horn shape makes it seem even heftier than a straight wand. Luckily, there’s a medium size available too.

Speeds: 10

Vibe patterns: 10

Power: rechargeable

Run time: two hours (but I suspect that’s only achievable for users who solely prefer the gentlest speed)

Charge time: two hours

Waterproof: yes

Warranty: one year, plus a 10-year quality guarantee

Best for long-distance lovers:

Kiiroo ProWand

£79.80 at Kiiroo

The ProWand is a lightweight, velvety wand built to be comfortable for extended use – and boasting an impressive 10-hour-plus run time.

Why we love it

The ProWand can be remotely controlled or connected to other compatible toys with the FeelConnect app, perfect for facilitating shared erotic experiences for lovers who live apart, or who frequently travel separately. I’ve worked with cybersecurity experts at Mozilla to investigate the hackability of internet-enabled sex toys, and the company’s report says Kiiroo “do[es] a pretty good job protecting users’ privacy and security”.

The glowing LED handle can be set to match the colour of lingerie and is dim enough to not illuminate that distracting pile of washing in the corner of your bedroom.

It’s a shame that … the app takes a second to get the hang of, although overall the setup and navigation are much simpler than others I’ve tried.

Speeds: five

Vibe patterns: six

Power: rechargeable

Runtime: 10+ hours

Charge time: four hours

Waterproof: yes

Warranty: one year

Best budget wand:

So Divine Wicked Game

£54.99 at So Divine

£54.99 at Oxygen Boutique

So Divine’s versatile value wand includes the option for vibrations to be emitted from each end of the toy.

Why we love it

This flexibility is a very good thing. Turn on the domed head at the top for external body massage or the insertable shaft at the bottom to enjoy penetration and internal stimulation. Despite this toy having dual motors, you can’t run both ends at once – although only the most adventurous among us would need that.

It’s a shame that … this toy doesn’t pack the power of pricier wands, and some prefer a material and design with more softness, flex and yield. However, it’s a great entry-level wand that gives you a chance to experiment with different stimulation styles and learn what you like before investing in a deluxe toy for three times the price.

Speeds: three

How I chose vibrators – and what you should consider

View image in fullscreen Think about what materials and textures feel inviting to you. Photograph: pcess609/Getty Images

At least 15 toys were tested in each category, with 53 tested in total. In addition to his links to love and lust, Saint Valentine is also the patron saint of beekeeping, so he would feel quite at home amid the cacophony of buzzing that soundtracked the production of this article.

I discounted any products not made from body-safe materials, such as porous jellies that can harbour bacteria and dirt, or plastics containing phthalates, which have been linked to cancer and hormonal interference. I considered things such as whether each device lived up to the claims made by its manufacturer; how easy it was to position and control; how fast it charged and how long the battery lasted, where relevant; and how attractive, adaptable, powerful and comfortable it was.

What I didn’t do was automatically label a toy as a “holy grail”, or an “almighty fail” if it didn’t happen to float my idiosyncratic boat, or provide what I personally need to reach orgasm, through no inherent fault of its own. Deciding upon the “best” vibrator is highly subjective, so I’ve tried to explain how different items might suit different folks.

When making your own considerations, useful questions to ask include:

Do I prefer gentle or potent vibrations (or both)? What styles of touch delight me, and do I want external or internal stimulation (or both)?

What shape and size of toy will suit my body and my tastes?

Do I want something simple, straightforward and intuitive, or experimental/multi-functional/tech-enabled?

What materials and textures feel inviting to me?

A note on volume: some reviews rate toys on how quiet they are, but I’ve NEVER met a vibe that’s as near-silent as it says it is. For that reason, I’ve only pointed out when a toy is notably loud enough to sound like you’ve rented it from a builders’ merchant.

In almost all cases, you do have to put your hand in your pocket if you want the best. Strong motors, neat details and high-performance designs don’t tend to come cheap. I believe pleasure should be accessible to all, though, so there’s at least one budget option included in each category. It’ll have some compromises, but it should give you plenty of “Ooh!” for not much dough.

Can vibrators decrease your sensitivity?

Let me reassure you: using vibrators will not cause nerve damage to your genitals. However, if, over a prolonged period, you always reach for a toy when masturbating – particularly if it’s a high-strength model like a mains-powered wand – you may inadvertently condition your body to become used to intense stimulation. Much like a curry fan who’s been mainlining vindaloo and is then served a masala, the comparatively gentle feelings provided by fingers or partners may begin to feel less spicy, and you may struggle to orgasm without the potent or pinpointed vibrations with which you’ve become familiar.

A similar problem arises for people with penises who hold themselves very tightly and use rough motions during solo play. American sex educator Dan Savage nicknamed this “the death grip”, and it can cause erectile dysfunction and difficulties ejaculating via the relative tenderness of intercourse.

Luckily, solutions are simple. First: chill out on your vibrator use, to give your body time to reappraise the delights of the delicate. You may want to try a period of abstinence, where you return to manual masturbation without grabbing a toy. Or if you’ve been cranking your toy’s power straight up to 11, try being a little less Spın̈al Tap and experimenting with softer speeds and patterns. Lubricant can help too, by cushioning sensitive tissues a little.

If you find that sex without toys simply doesn’t feel as good, another option is to involve your toys in sex. Contrary to many people’s fears, vibrators can’t replace the profound intimacy and thrill of being with another human being, but they can vastly enhance shared experiences – they’re complementary co-pilots, not competitors.

If you’re someone who feels threatened by toys, it may help to think of them as specialist equipment. You wouldn’t feel emasculated or belittled if you had to equip yourself with an axe to cut down a tree instead of just using your bare hands, right? Instead, it’s more impressive to learn to wield that equipment like a pro; whether you want to chop timber or set your partner’s night alight. Using the right apparatus the right way is the fastest route to successfully starting a fire. Ask your lover to show you how they like the toy to be positioned, and be eager to take on any feedback they give.

"Yari Club, London WC2: ‘I didn’t expect the robot chef to be simply a deep-fat fryer’ – restaurant review",['Grace Dent'],2025-02-28,"Yari Club in Covent Garden, London, is a robot yakitori restaurant. I’ll break that down for you. “Robot”, as in the food is prepared by our new mechanical overlords. “Yakitori” is, essentially, meat grilled on small skewers – think tiny Japanese kebabs dipped in sauces. And then, of course, “restaurant”, as in that place where humans once had jobs before the robots took over. Bleeding robots, eh, clanking in here, taking our jobs?

In fact, Yari Club’s “robot” sits in the window of the shop, seemingly to taunt passing Michelin-starred chefs who believe the world will cease to spin if these culinary gods are not up by 5am to source fennel pollen and beech sap. Real chefs can be a huge pain: pricey, sulky and fickle. But there are no such problems with the chef at Yari Club, because it’s a big stainless-steel box filled with hot oil. Despite that jaw-dropping, futuristic aspect being trumpeted loudly in all the marketing, this particular robot is, at first glance, hugely disappointing. Less robotic than I’d imagined (or hoped for) and more simply a deeply unattractive kitchen gadget. Skewers of chicken hearts, chicken gizzard, chicken wings and every other imaginable bits of a chicken are loaded on to a pulley, dragged through hot oil for a robotically precise number of minutes to make them succulent, then dipped into a special, sweet, soy-based sauce to finish.

What was I expecting? One of the 1980s mime duo Tik + Tok wearing an apron and beckoning me inside to eat microchips in a repurposed spacecraft? No, but neither did I expect the robot to be simply a no-frills deep-fat fryer, or – and this is the kicker – for it to rely so heavily on humans to do its job. On the lunchtime I visited, Yari Club was almost empty, while Berwick Street market just up the road in Soho was absolutely heaving with lunch-hour workers queueing at its plethora of food trucks, or at the newish pizza spot Breadstall, where artisan slices of cheesy carbs are cooked and served by human hand. Oddly, there seems to be something about the big, spitty, oil-stained Yari Club robot that isn’t drawing the crowds.

View image in fullscreen One of Yari Club’s ‘whopping’ bento boxes – the Kyoto bento.

At first glance, Yari Club’s menu might seem a little limited, especially if you’re not in the mood for autopsied chicken on a stick, or to eat it in an unlovable, brown “cafe” space that’s about as cosy as the waiting room in a regional minicab office. In actual fact, however, there’s a lot to love about the food at Yari Club, although it will take a good 10 minutes to work that out, even with the help of a wonderful front-of-house person who pointed out the bento boxes, the katsu curries and the very moreish corn ball options, which turned out to be deep-fried clusters of spicy, crunchy sweetcorn, and completely irresistible. It took another server to point out the tsukune chicken meatball skewers, the mulled sake, the winter specials menu, the padrón peppers and the vegetable tempura.

In fact, all the Yari Club’s robot experience does is underline quite how brilliant humans are, what with their opposable thumbs, patience and empathy, and how much hospitality needs them to survive. The Yari Club robot owes a great debt to real-life hospitality staff, because it can’t, for a start, process orders, load up its own skewers or put them on plates. It also can’t cater for vegans, it seems: one potential diner walked in, asked if the tofu scallion option could be cooked without touching chicken fat, was met with bemused looks and flounced out. In a normal restaurant, someone would have bargained with that customer, but robot yakitori not care about the flounce.

View image in fullscreen Yari Club’s spiced sake has the potential to be ‘a migraine in a paper cup’.

All that said, the food at Yari Club is really rather good and, at about £3.80 for two skewers, very reasonably priced, too. The momo chicken thigh skewer, the classic negima chicken, the teba chicken wings and the prawn tempura are all undeniably delicious: crisp, juicy, tender, smoky when they need to be, and soft and sweet in other places. For all of £13.80, you can build a whopping bento box featuring six skewers, rice or salad, coleslaw, pickles, nori and more of the special-blend, umami flavour bomb that is Yari’s dipping sauce. The mulled sake, meanwhile, has all the whack of sake combined with the synthetic aspect of supermarket mulled wine mix; a migraine in a paper cup. They have Coedo Shikkoko black lager and oolong tea in cans, too, as well lots of nice Japanese teas.

I’d go back to Yari Club for a snack, but it’s not really worth travelling out of your way for. There are more impressive robots at the Asda self-checkout. I have met our new hospitality robotic overlords and, as things stand, they still need our help.

Yari Club 57 St Martin’s Lane, London WC2, hello@yariclub.com (no phone). Open all week, Mon-Sat 11.30am-8.30pm, Sun noon-8.30pm. From about £15 a head, plus drinks and service"
Ravneet Gill’s chocolate and miso skillet cookie with a quick banana ice-cream,['Ravneet Gill'],2025-02-28,"This speedy dessert, which you can have ready in less than 20 minutes (and 14 of those being baking time), can be scaled up according to how many mouths you want to feed. I like the umami hit of miso and its saltiness next to the soft and sweet banana ice-cream, but it can be swapped for peanut butter, if you prefer.

Chocolate and miso skillet cookie for sharing, with quick banana ice-cream

You will need a 15cm skillet or small baking dish.

Prep 5 min

Cook 20 min

Serves 2



90g softened unsalted butter

40g light brown sugar

55g plain flour

½ tsp baking powder

1 egg

30g dark chocolate, chopped

½ tsp white miso

For the banana ice-cream

2 frozen bananas, peeled

2 tbsp milk (any variety)

1 tbsp maple syrup (optional)

A pinch of sea salt

Heat the oven to 185C (165C fan)/360F/gas 4½. Combine the butter, sugar, flour, baking powder, egg and chocolate in a food processor, stand mixer or by hand in a large bowl, to make a smooth dough, then transfer to a 15cm skillet or small baking dish. Using a teaspoon, spread the miso on top, and swirl it evenly into the dough. Bake for 14 minutes, until the edges are lightly golden but the centre remains soft.

There are cookie recipes galore and many more on the new Feast app: scan or click here for your free trial.

To make the ice-cream, blitz the frozen bananas, milk, maple syrup (if using) and a pinch of salt in a blender or food processor until smooth and creamy. If you’re not serving it immediately, transfer to an airtight container and freeze for later.

Serve the warm cookie straight from the skillet with scoops of the ice-cream on top."
Experience: I donated my uterus to a stranger – now we’re close friends,[],2025-02-28,"One day in June 2019, I was getting ready for work when a story on TV caught my attention. A woman was talking about donating her womb to a stranger. She explained why she’d decided to give someone the chance to experience pregnancy. As a mother of two, I was blown away.

At lunch I was glued to my phone, reading everything I could about the procedure: how the first successful uterus transplant had taken place in Sweden in 2013, and how the operation had been carried out in the US since 2016. How it was helping women who had lost their uteri due to cancer, or never developed one because of the congenital condition Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH).

I was 39, hadn’t experienced infertility, and had never considered organ donation before. But something about it touched me deeply. When I read that Penn Medicine hospital, just 40 minutes from our home in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, had a uterus transplant programme, it sealed the deal.

I told my husband, Brian, about my plans, and applied the next day. For 12 weeks, I was evaluated by a surgical team, an infectious disease doctor and a psychiatrist. They needed to know that I was strong enough to deal with the procedures and the possibility that it might not work.

The risks were set out: after surgery, I could face problems with my bowel and bladder. It was a major operation. It was also made clear that, if it was successful, I wouldn’t know who had received my uterus. I had to agree that I would not try to search for her.

I was accepted on the programme, and they started looking for a match. Then, in January, I got the call that they’d found someone. I got chills.

As we approached the surgery date in February 2020, I thought about the recipient constantly. Our children, Ava, then 10, and Aidan, nine, were amazing. They understood that I was doing it to help another woman become a mum.

Sitting in the waiting room was the wildest feeling. They kept me and my recipient in different wings of the hospital, so we couldn’t accidentally meet. But I couldn’t help looking at every woman who walked past. Could this be her? As I lay down for surgery, I felt my heart thumping – but it was more from anticipation than nerves.

Waking up, my only thought was: did it work? When I heard it had, I cried, overwhelmed with joy. My recovery was tough. I needed a second surgery. But I didn’t regret my decision.

Afterwards, I kept wondering about the recipient. Was it the woman behind me in the coffee shop or on the school run? A few months later, with the help of social workers, we were allowed to send each other screened messages. They were vague, but just hearing that she was well was incredible.

It was clear that we both wanted to communicate openly, and our social workers allowed it. Her first email said, “How wonderful to know the name of the woman who so generously gave me the opportunity of creating life.” I cried.

Her name was Chelsea, and she’d discovered at 15 that she had MRKH. Desperate to become a mother, she’d almost lost hope. Surrogacy hadn’t worked. Then she discovered uterus donation. She and her husband had moved 1,900 miles from Montana to join the programme. It had worked. She was expecting a baby.

Our messages turned into texts and calls, and then she invited me to visit her in May 2021 to see her maternity photoshoot. Turning the corner, I saw her holding her pregnant belly. We ran into each other’s arms.

Hearing that her son, Telden, had been born shortly after our meeting was joyful. It felt like another member of our family had arrived. When I held him for the first time, I was speechless.

In the years since, my bond with Chelsea has grown. We speak every week and visit as often as we can. I was so happy when she had her second son, Stetson, in October 2022. My kids adore her kids – seeing them all together makes me so happy. They share a unique bond: they were grown in the same uterus, but in different bodies.

I look at them and feel grateful: to the news story that changed my life, to the miracle of science that allowed this, and to Chelsea, a former stranger who will for ever be my soul sister.

Liquid optimism: why Babycham is ripe for a revival,['Hannah Crosbie'],2025-02-28,"Although the past is rarely ever as simple or as delicious as we remember it, it seems that culinary nostalgia is very much in vogue. Take the gelatinous success of Instagram accounts such as 70s Dinner Party or the unfathomable cool-ification of devilled eggs. Another thing that’s deserving of a prance back into popularity is Babycham. It’s kitsch in a bottle. Liquid, postwar optimism. And it’s potentially up for a modern revival. Or at least I want it to be, so I’m writing a column about it. It’s called manifesting.

The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.

For those who didn’t live through its heyday, Babycham is a sparkling perry, which is like cider, except made from pears. Originally named Champagne de la Poire, Babycham was created by the Showering cider family from pears they saw going to waste when they were buying from local apple orchards. In a postwar world, Herbert Showering saw the changes in drinking habits among women, and an opportunity to create a drink targeted specifically at them.

And so Babycham sparkling perry was born. Dinky glasses, handsome men and extremely flammable dresses painted a picture of glamorous, feminine and moderated drinking. Back then, it was an aspirational picture for an emerging middle class; today, however, the obvious attempt to market to women by men feels dated and cynical. If you’d like some further reading on this, drinks writer Rachel Hendry wrote a sparkling deep-dive on Babycham as a precautionary tale about heavily gendered marketing and the part it had to play in the drink falling out of favour with a 21st-century audience.

But a modern Babycham is more than deserving of a revival. In 2021, some 70 years after its launch, the sons of the original Showering brothers bought back the brand from Accolade Wines, with the aspiration to “modernise” it to “new and familiar customers” (if they’re looking for a new Babycham girl, my DMs are open). At 6% ABV and with a sweet, fruity palate, it makes a lot of sense in the current market, where low-alcohol and storied drinks are favoured among a younger generation. If you like the sweet, soft fruitiness of prosecco, for example, you’ll probably like Babycham.

Other than drinking it straight, try treating it as you would sparkling wine in a cocktail. Anywhere you’d pop prosecco, use Babycham. Mix it into a sgroppino. Pour it into a bellini. Serve it alongside a pornstar martini. I even once had it at an underground bar mixed with eau de vie and raspberry syrup, though I don’t remember a great deal after that.

Babycham, plus three things to mix it with

Babycham Sparkling Perry £3.50 (4 x 200ml) Tesco, 6%. Original-recipe, uncut Babycham. Fresh, light and ripe.

Lockdown Liquor & Co Passionfruit Martini £25 (500ml) Lockdown Liquor & Co, 14%. Serve a chaser of Babycham with your martini.

Funkin White Peach Purée £11.20 (1kg) Ocado. Baby bellinis, anyone? There’s a kilo of the stuff in this pouch, but it’ll last for a week (maybe more). One for birthday celebrations, perhaps.

Vault Aperitivo Bitter £35 (700ml) Vault Aperitivo, 29.6%. Mix this British vermouth with Babycham to make a baby sbagliato (or should that be a babliato?)."
You be the judge: should my early-rising flatmate keep the noise down while I’m still in bed?,['Georgina Lawton'],2025-02-28,"The prosecution: Reggie

I hate talking to anyone for the first two hours of my day. I think that should be respected

Living with an early riser when you’re not one yourself can drastically decrease your quality of life. I should know, I live with Kevin.

I like the fact he is an organised flatmate. He always makes enough food for two and he’s very tidy. But he gets up so early and makes a lot of noise, which really winds me up.

Every Sunday, while I’m still in bed, Kevin stomps around in the kitchen at 8am, making a smoothie before the gym. I’ll drift back to sleep, but then he comes back two hours later and makes breakfast, clattering pans and playing music loudly.

I’m glad he’s so happy and I don’t want to control when he gets up, but I’d love it if he could keep the noise down.

Kevin says he physically can’t sleep in. That’s fine. But why should I suffer just because he’s an early bird? Sometimes Kevin jokes that I’m lazy, but we just have different body clocks.

When I hear Kevin stomping around in his work shoes on our wooden floors, or opening and closing the fridge, it’s jarring

I get up around midday on the weekend. I don’t feel bad about it. During the week, our schedules work a bit better: Kevin is up at 6.45am, showers and makes breakfast before I rise at 9am for work.

But sometimes, when I hear Kevin stomping around in his work shoes on our wooden floors, or opening and closing the fridge, it’s jarring. Even more so than at the weekends, because sleep before work is precious.

On the other hand, Kevin has been my personal alarm clock on occasions. He says I should be grateful for the noise in the week because I’ve been known to be late starting work when I’ve accidentally slept in. But generally, I’m not a morning person and I hate talking to anyone for the first two hours of my day. I think that should be respected.

Kevin says I should try getting up earlier as it would make everything easier, but why should I? Late sleepers always get a bad rep, but I’m actually just as productive as Kevin.

I would really appreciate it if he stopped pressuring me to become an early riser and simply worked on being quieter. I don’t think I need to change.

The defence: Kevin

Reggie is a night owl. I can hear him after midnight sometimes, but I don’t say anything

The early bird catches the worm. It’s a well-worn adage for a reason. Early risers are known to have better sleep, better moods and are even at a lower risk of certain cancers.

I like getting up early and starting my day with purpose. I don’t use the snooze button and I don’t feel groggy in the mornings: I hop out of bed. I think Reggie wishes he could be like me, but because he isn’t one of those people who gets up with the lark, he wants to control my schedule and noise output.

I don’t deliberately try to wake him up, but if I need to go to work or the gym, that involves walking along the hall in our flat and making breakfast. Sometimes, I’ll come back from the gym at midday and Reggie is still in bed. If he wants me to be quieter, he needs to have a reasonable cut-off time for making noise in the mornings, particularly at the weekend.

There have also been times I’ve woken Reggie up and he’s been grateful

During the week, for example, we both agreed that noise after 11pm isn’t acceptable. But Reggie is a night owl, and when I’m in bed I sometimes hear him shuffling around, playing music or eating. I don’t often say anything, even if it goes on until midnight. But I don’t think he affords me the same privilege in the mornings.

It’s less acceptable to ask me not to make noise at midday on a Saturday. It’s the weekend! By midday, the day is half gone. The world is awake and Reggie should be too. He’s 32, not a child. I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect me to make food silently, or tiptoe around because he’s still asleep.

There have also been times I’ve woken Reggie up and he’s been grateful. He slept in after a night out once, and I had to wake him up for work. If both of us were night owls, the flat would be chaos.

I can try to be a bit more considerate with noise in the mornings, but it would be easier for us both if Reggie got up at a reasonable time on the weekends – around 10am – so I don’t have to worry about making breakfast after the gym.

The jury of Guardian readers

Should Kevin pipe down in the morning?

I’m for Kevin’s seize-the-day approach. Life is short and Reggie is missing out by spending half the day in bed. Be grateful, Reggie, that you have a human alarm clock to remind you the day is ticking away.

Jo, 37

The solution for more harmonious cohabitation is obvious: Kevin lingers in bed for another hour at weekends while Reggie goes to bed a bit earlier. But Kevin should also make less noise by not preparing the loudest breakfast possible and stomping around in work shoes on a wooden floor early doors.

Frederico, 48

This is a tough one to call as it must be really difficult for a night owl and an early bird to live in the same nest easily. Earplugs for both of them would help, but if I must choose then I’m with Kevin: the world can’t tiptoe around you just because you don’t like mornings, Reggie.

Dervla, 30

Reggie is embarrassing himself. Why should Kevin make a big effort to be silent just so Reggie can sleep even longer? Kevin has every right to make a smoothie and have breakfast in the flat before going to work. Deal with it Reggie!

Simeon, 28

Sharing a flat means being tolerant and willing to compromise. Having different body clocks is normal but when Reggie says: “I don’t think I need to change”, what incentive is he offering Kevin to change? So not guilty for me.

Dalilah, 51

Parents in England: share your experiences of NHS dental services for your children,['Guardian Community Team'],2025-02-26,"According to a government report, nearly 50,000 tooth extractions took place last year in NHS hospitals in England for 0 to 19-year-olds, with 62% of those having a primary diagnosis of tooth decay.

We would like to hear from parents in England about their experiences of accessing NHS dental services for their children. Were you able to find somewhere locally or do you have to travel further afield? How easy have you found it to access care? We’re also interested in hearing from those whose children have had hospital tooth extractions recently."
Nature boys and girls – here’s your chance to get published in the Guardian,['Guardian Community Team'],2021-08-27,"Once again, the Young Country Diary series is open for submissions! Every three months, as the UK enters a new season, we ask you to send us an article written by a child aged 8-14.

The article needs to be about a recent encounter they’ve had with nature – whether it’s a field of early spring flowers, a nest-building bird or a pond full of frogspawn.

Crucially, it doesn’t matter if the child is a nature expert or has never picked up a pair of binoculars. We are especially keen to reach teachers who might like to get their class outside and noticing nature.

The deadline for submissions is noon on Monday 31 March.

Six winning entries will be chosen. These will be published in the Guardian newspaper and online – two in March, two in April and a final two in May. Then on 1 June the form will reopen again below, for articles about summer.

Note that if you send your piece in early enough, you stand a chance of being published on 22 March.

How your child can take part

First of all, we’re looking for children age 8 to 14, so we will need your permission, as parent or guardian. Then here’s what the child needs to do:

Step 1 – Go out one day to where there is some nature. It could be their local woods or beach, their garden, a farm, or simply the nearest park.

Step 2 – Write an article of 200-250 words telling us what they saw and what happened.

Step 3 – Send the article to us using the form below. We ask that you fill in the form yourself rather than the child.

Photos/drawings – These are helpful (especially landscape rather than portrait) but they are not a condition of entry. If you have some, please tell us in the “more information” field, as there’s no way to attach them to the form.

Hints and tips for any budding YCD writers

If the child gets stuck and doesn’t know what to write about, here are a few pointers:

Good nature writing starts with the senses – so what did you see and hear? What about smell and touch? Take notes when you’re out and about so you don’t forget

How would you describe what happened? Did it remind you of anything?

It’s great to look up some extra information about what you saw, and tell us about that too. For example, if you find an interesting-looking bug, see if you can find out what type of butterfly it was, how long they live – any juicy titbits!

You can think big, and describe the whole scene – the sky, the horizon, the landscape. Or you can think small, and tell us some details about the butterfly’s wings or the beetle’s markings.

What did your encounter with nature make you think about? How did it make you feel?

The deadline for entry is noon on Monday 31 March. Anyone can enter their child who is aged between 8 and 14 and based in the UK. You the parent/guardian will be contacted if your child’s piece is selected for publication, and you will be paid on behalf of the child.

‘We brought him 4kg of ice-cream’: Pope Francis’s parlour shares papal favourites,['Angela Giuffrida'],2025-02-28,"When Sebastian Padrón opened his ice-cream parlour around the corner from Pope Francis’s home in Casa Santa Marta in Vatican City, his wife, Silvia, came up with a clever way of ingratiating her husband with his fellow Argentinian.

“She told me: ‘Go and bring an ice-cream to Pope Francis,’” said Padrón. “I said: ‘Impossible.’”

Dismissing her husband’s scepticism, Silvia decided to take on the task herself. She scurried over to Casa Santa Marta, in a building adjacent to St Peter’s Basilica, and asked a Swiss guard if she could bring some ice-cream for the pontiff.

“The Swiss guard said yes, and that whatever she brings to the pope he will gladly receive it. So we brought him 4kg of ice-cream.”

It was 2018, and ice-cream orders from Pope Francis and other high-ranking Vatican officials became regular, marking the start of a friendship between the Padrón family and the pontiff, whose favourite flavour is dulce de leche, a typical Argentinian caramel dessert, although he also likes lemon and mango.

But Padrón really captured the pope’s heart in 2020, after coronavirus lockdown restrictions were eased, by sending him a home-made empanada, the Argentinian equivalent of a Cornish pasty.

Again, it was Silvia’s intervention that did the trick. “She wrote a message on the empanada saying: ‘It’s about time we met’,” said Padrón. “Francis then called me and invited the family to Casa Santa Marta. I was so nervous but he made us feel completely relaxed. He’s a very kind, simple person.”

Francis, who has been in hospital with pneumonia for two weeks, was a regular visitor to the Italian capital before becoming pope in 2013, making friends with several shopkeepers, including keeping up visits to the premises of some despite his movements in public being limited, before his current bout of illness.

Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on 14 February after struggling to breathe and was subsequently diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and pneumonia in both lungs. His condition has been touch and go but there has been a slight improvement in recent days. However, as of Thursday, medics still gave a “guarded” prognosis, meaning he was not yet out of danger.

The mood among well-wishers in Rome has been one of apprehension. “We hope that he continues to get better, but I’m a little worried,” said Cristina who was in St Peter’s Square with her husband, Mario. “He was very much for ordinary people. We live in Rome … we’ve never met him but he feels more like a parish priest than a pope, such is his humility.”

His relationships with local shopkeepers are seen by many as a testament to the humility of the pope, although some traders initially feared when he took up the papacy that his frugal approach might not favour them.

“[When Francis became pope] he immediately started working to simplify things,” said Raniero Mancinelli, a tailor who owns Mancinelli Clero, a historic shop in Borgo Pio, next to the Vatican, that produces ecclesiastical robes and jewellery. “We were a little concerned that this would mean cutting out a bit of luxury. But in the end we carried on working as usual.”

Mancinelli, who has fitted out garments for Francis and met him personally, added: “One might say he’s stubborn, but I disagree. Yes, he’s someone who is direct and likes to get things done. We are really rooting for him to pull through and want to see him back at St Peter’s. Francis – the people are waiting for you.”

Among the pope’s other shopkeeper friends in Rome are Alessandro Spieza, an optician on Via del Babuino in the city’s historic centre. The pope has occasionally turned up at the shop unannounced, arriving in his modest Fiat 500 or Ford Focus.

In 2022, Francis, a lover of classical music, slipped out of the Vatican one evening to visit old friends at Stereosound, a music shop next to the Pantheon. He was there to bless the shop’s new renovations and left with a gift box containing vinyls. Neither Spieza nor the owner of Stereosound wanted to recount their experiences to journalists, out of respect for the pope and his health.

Nightly prayers vigils for the pope’s health are being held at St Peter’s basilica and in towns and cities across Italy and abroad, especially in his home city of Buenos Aires.

“May our prayer be the breath of air that Pope Francis’s lungs need. Do not slow down. We need you very much,” Jorge Ignacio García Cuerva, the archbishop of Buenos Aires, said this week."
‘I decided I was done’: Canada pizzeria boycotts US ingredients in tariff dispute,['Olivia Bowden'],2025-02-28,"Tucked away in a former garage space in Toronto’s west end, Gram’s Pizza is usually packed with diners hankering for anything from a classic pepperoni to vodka and hot hawaiian.

Lately, however, owner and chef Graham Palmateer has made some changes to how he makes his pizzas.

After Donald Trump threatened to slap a 25% tariff on Canadian goods – and even to annex the whole country – Palmateer decided to banish US ingredients from his restaurant.

“I just decided I was done with the US. I wanted to move away from American companies,” he said. “Canadians know Americans pretty well, and we don’t always agree with the choices that they make. A lot of us are disappointed, to put it mildly.”

Making the switch has not been the easiest task: the two countries’ economies have been tightly bound through a longstanding free trade agreement since the late 1980s.

But years of cross-border trade and investment has blurred the lines on country of origin: in the car manufacturing industry, for example, a vehicle passes the border an average of seven times during the manufacturing process.

Those attempting to impose a full boycott of consumer goods have been caught off-guard at grocery stores where “Made In Canada” products might contain some US ingredients.

And while Canada’s political leaders have at times appeared to be flailing in their response to Trump’s threat, ordinary Canadians have decided to get their retaliation in early, and boycott American goods.

A poll this month by the Angus Reid Institute published found that since Trump revived his threat of tariffs, four in five Canadians have been buying more Canadian products.

Some grocery stores have even labeled which items are made by Canadian producers. Bar Sazerac in Hamilton, about an hour west of Toronto, is no longer using American alcohol in its menu.

Palmateer said his transition to Canadian ingredients had some bumps initially. He had trouble sourcing Canadian diet soda, while some items, like mushrooms, are more expensive to source locally. Instead of Californian tomatoes, he opted for canned ones from Italy.

But he has since gotten into the swing of things. He uses a Quebec-based company to source pepperoni, the flour he uses is made with Ontario grain and cheese is easy to source from Canadian suppliers.

The cost of operating has increased slightly, “but by and large, I haven’t had to change pricing”, he said.

Kenneth Wong, an associate professor at the business school at Queen’s University in Ontario, said he had been surprised by an apparently organic response among Canadian consumers: on a visit to his local grocery store, homegrown apples were sold out, while next to them, a bin of US apples appeared to be untouched.

“Canadians are bearing down in ways I never thought they would,” he said.

After appearing to relent on the tariff threat, Trump on Thursday repeated his intention to apply the levy on imports from Canada on Mexico from 4 March.

The continuing uncertainty has prompted Canadian provinces to lift some internal trade barriers – a move which Wong said could somewhat reduce Canada’s strong reliance on the US.

“And once that fully happens, tastes will change and habits will form. I’m not saying you can’t win back your consumer if you’re a US firm, but I am saying it’s going to be a lot more expensive to do so,” he said.

Palmateer said his customer base seemed to be happy with his choice to shun American products. “It’s pretty much been positive. ‘Good for you’ kind of comments,” he said.

One customer was upset they could no longer drink a Sprite with their Pizza. But Palmateer has since found Canadian soda brands like Sap Sucker which he hopes will fit the bill. Either way, he says he will not go back to using US ingredients.

“This boycott … is my way of voting with my dollar,” he says. “If it encourages someone else to also do the same thing and divest, that’s a good step.”"
Trump tried to extort Zelenskyy and was impeached – now he may succeed,['David Smith'],2025-02-28,"Alexander Vindman remembers the phone call – and what he did next. Serving on the national security council (NSC), he went to see his twin brother, who was the council’s senior ethics official, closed the door and told him: “Eugene, if what I’m about to tell you ever becomes public, Donald Trump will be impeached.”

Vindman had set up a call between Trump and Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in July 2019. He heard the US president attempt to leverage US military aid to the country in return for Zelenskyy launching an investigation into Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, over his position at a Ukrainian gas company.

Trump was indeed impeached for offering a quid pro quo in the hope of finding dirt on a political rival. But six years on, the incident haunts current negotiations over ending Ukraine’s war with Russia, including a deal for continued US military aid in exchange for access to Ukraine’s valuable mineral resources.

With Zelenskyy due to visit the White House on Friday, observers warn that Trump is trying to strong-arm him again.

“In the course of this one phone call, President Trump implicated himself by saying that Ukraine would have to do him a favour in order to get access to the congressionally appropriated $400m and a meeting,” recalled Vindman, author of a new book, The Folly of Realism: How the West Deceived Itself About Russia and Betrayed Ukraine. “How much that rhymes with what’s going on this Friday with President Zelenskyy coming in – and another kind of shakedown for billions of dollars in order to continue to receive support.”

Vindman was the NSC’s director of European affairs at the time of the phone call that Trump later described as “perfect”. After informing his brother, he filed a formal report about Trump’s “corrupt scheme” that led to televised hearings and Trump becoming only the third president in history to be impeached by the House of Representatives, though he was subsequently acquitted by the Senate.

The news was monumental at the time but has been somewhat eclipsed in collective memory by Trump’s second impeachment, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and Trump’s return to the White House last month. Trump’s allies and the rightwing media have also worked relentlessly to denigrate both the impeachment and the Russia investigation – in which Ukraine also played a leading role – as hoaxes.

The Trump-Zelenskyy relationship, so cordial in 2019, has soured fast. When America’s top diplomat met his Russian counterpart in Saudi Arabia last week to discuss an end to the Ukraine war, Ukraine was not in the room. When Trump claimed that Ukraine was to blame for Russia’s invasion, remarks that echoed Kremlin talking points, Zelenskyy said Trump was “trapped” in a Russian “disinformation bubble”.

Trump responded furiously, branding Zelenskyy a “dictator” for not holding elections during wartime, when swaths of Ukraine are under Russian occupation, its soldiers are on the frontlines and the country is under martial law.

Earlier this week, in a stunning shift in transatlantic relations, the US split with its European allies by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in votes on three UN resolutions seeking an end to the three-year war.

Under this shadow, Zelenskyy is due to visit Washington on Friday to sign a deal that, in Trump’s framing, would give the US access to Ukraine’s deposits of so-called rare earth minerals – used in the aerospace, defence and nuclear industries – as a way of Kyiv paying back for aid already sent for the war effort under Biden.

There are similarities with the first quid pro quo – but also differences. Vindman reflected: “He’s not shaking down Ukraine to steal an election this time. There is a national security element. The US needs rare earths for the economy. Ukraine needs investment. So this one actually, in some strange way, even though the scale is magnified, is far more legitimate than the last go around – even though it does come across as a shakedown and completely anti-American in the way we do business around the world.”

Zelenskyy also finds himself in a changed, more vulnerable position. He has said more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and more than 390,000 wounded, but other estimates are far higher. Trump’s intemperate rhetoric has hurt morale. Russia is making advances on the battlefield.

Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies thintank in Washington, said: “Ukraine is far, far more desperate than it was in 2019. We have a country that is being assaulted and pummeled by the Russians every minute, so the stakes could not be higher for Ukraine.”

The minerals deal was a perfect example of how difficult it is for Ukraine to navigate the situation, added Bergmann, a former state department official. “The Ukrainians realised that not signing this deal, which is very hypothetical and wouldn’t really come to fruition – companies aren’t going to begin excavating until there’s an actual peace settlement – wasn’t worth fighting over. But it also further demonstrates the lack of interest and commitment that the US has to supporting Ukraine.”

Trump’s first month on the foreign policy stage has come at a head-spinning pace, with plans to take over and redevelop Gaza, buy Greenland from Denmark, seize the Panama canal and absorb Canada as the 51st state. But nothing is more contrary to the Republican party of old than Trump’s willingness to side with Russia over democratic allies.

Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state, said: “We don’t know yet about any personal benefit per se to the president but we do know that he’s using the threat of withholding of military aid and American support for Ukraine in this process as a pressure tactic to extract concessions. That’s typically what you do with your adversary. In this case also it’s not at all clear who would get the money. How does this work? How does this advance America’s global standing and our economy?”

At a cabinet meeting on Wednesday Trump hailed the minerals deal as “a very big agreement” and on Thursday, at a meeting with British prime minister Keir Starmer, he suggested that the presence of American workers extracting critical minerals would act as the kind of security backstop that allies are seeking to deter Russia from invading again.

But Rubin is sceptical that an economic agreement will necessarily guarantee Ukraine’s future security. “Who’s to say that Russia wouldn’t decide they’re going to invade Ukraine but before that they’re going to call the United States and say, we’re going to invade and take over Ukraine but that minerals deal you have with Ukraine, we will maintain and we will do it with you? Then they go and invade and the US says, well, as long as we have our deal, we’re OK with it. There’s nothing to prevent that.”"
The secret bond that helped two captive women survive Mozambique’s Islamists,[],2025-02-28,"Ancha*, who was 20, had been kidnapped and held captive in a house in northern Mozambique for two months when 17-year-old Fatima* was brought there. What their captors did not know – even after the young women’s daring escape together – was that they were cousins.

Both had grown up around Mucojo, a small coastal town 130 miles (210km) south of the Tanzanian border, from where they had been abducted in separate raids in 2020 by Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jamaa militants, an Islamic State-affiliated group known locally as al-Shabaab (though it has no links with the Islamist militants of the same name in Somalia).

The group has been kidnapping and killing girls and women as it fights government and African Union forces in the country’s northernmost province of Cabo Delgado since the conflict began in 2017. More than 1 million people are reported to have been displaced by fighting in the region.

All we did was remember what our lives had been like … and dream about the future Ancha

Before their abduction, Ancha and Fatima had not known each other well and lived in separate villages, but all that changed when Fatima arrived at their captor’s house. From that moment, the two women formed a close friendship that has endured.

“At first [when she arrived], I felt very sad. But then I thought, finally, I had someone to lean on. I went from being isolated and alone to having someone to share my time with,” says Ancha.

For three years, the two cousins were forced to live with insurgents in separate homes, enduring constant sexual violence. Ancha has two children as a result, both aged under three.

Fatima, who has a three-year-old, says she was mostly kept locked inside as the man she had to live with feared she would try to escape. “Sometimes, I was allowed to go to a garden nearby, but never far.”

Despite the abuse they suffered, the two women spent most of their time together talking about the past. “All we did was remember what our lives had been like before and dream about the future,” says Ancha.

“We helped each other with everything. If one of us was forced to fetch food, the other would watch over the children,” says Ancha.

Fatima adds: “We ate together, checked in on each other. It was a great source of support for me.”

Having each other nearby also comforted them in another way, says Ancha: if one of them had died, the other could one day inform their family.

Their family links were kept a secret. “We decided not to tell anyone we were cousins because they might separate us” says Ancha.

“In that place, more than two women gathering was not allowed, so we kept it a secret to keep seeing each other.”

Eventually, last September, says Fatima, they hatched a plan to escape together. “We couldn’t live like that any more,” she recalls.

“There was no food, no medicine – just constant abuse. We decided we had to take the risk and leave.”

The plan involved fleeing through the forest to the coast, where a small boat would be awaiting them, ready to sail to freedom. The boat was arranged by some men from the camp who decided to escape with them. Ancha says the men had previously been prisoners too before being forced to join the militants during their years in captivity.

“During those days in the forest, we [Ancha and Fatima] helped each other, encouraging one another to keep going. When Ancha lagged behind, exhausted, I pushed her forward, and she did the same for me. We also helped carry each other’s babies,” says Fatima.

After reaching the beach, they were taken by a small wooden boat northwards towards Mocímboa da Praia, Cabo Delgado’s second-largest city.

There they were intercepted by soldiers of the Rwanda Defence Forces, which maintains two military bases in the city and has deployed about 5,000 troops to support the Mozambican government since 2021.

The two women were then transferred back to where they grew up after relatives recognised their names on a list of people awaiting reunification with their families, and are now both living in a camp for displaced people with them in the town of Macomia.

“The bond we formed can never be broken. If I go two days without seeing Fatima, I visit her and she does the same with me,” says Ancha.

‘They’ve lost my trust’: consumers shun companies as bosses kowtow to Trump,"['Lauren Aratani', 'Guardian Community Team']",2025-02-28,"In late January, Lauren Bedson did what many would likely find unthinkable: she cancelled her Amazon Prime membership. The catalyst was Donald Trump’s inauguration. Many more Americans are planning to make similar decisions this Friday.

Bedson made her move after seeing photos of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, sitting with other tech moguls and billionaires, including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai, just rows behind Trump at his inauguration.

“I just couldn’t stand to see them so cowardly,” Bedson, of Camas, Washington, told the Guardian. “I lived in Seattle for over a decade. I was a fan of Amazon for a long time, I think they have a good product. But I’m just so disgusted. I don’t want to give these billionaire oligarchs any more of my money.”

It’s a sentiment that many Americans have been feeling since Trump entered the White House. Companies and business leaders who were once passive or vocally critical of Trump are now trying to cozy up to him, leading consumers to question the values of the brands they used to trust. A recent Harris poll found that a quarter of American consumers have stopped shopping at their favorite stores because of shifting political stances.

Many are being inspired by calls to boycott coming from social media. One boycott has gone viral over the last few weeks: a “blackout” of companies that dropped some of their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) goals, including Target, Amazon and Walmart, is planned for 28 February with protesters planning to halt all spending at these corporations for the day.

But people are also making the decision to boycott at their kitchen tables, trying to figure out how to resist Trump, and perhaps corporate capitalism at large, within their own communities.

The Guardian asked readers how their shopping habits have changed over the last few months, as the political climate started to shift after Trump’s win. Hundreds from across the country said that they have stopped shopping at stores such as Walmart and Target that publicly announced the end of DEI goals. Dozens like Bedson had cancelled long held Prime accounts. Others have shut down their Facebook and Instagram accounts in protest of Meta.

“I’m just trying to do little things that make me feel a little bit empowered, to stake my claim against what’s happening and how companies are acting in ways that are opposed to my values,” said Kim Wohlenhaus, of St Louis, Missouri, who cancelled her Prime membership, deleted her Meta accounts and has stopped shopping at Target. “It feels good to be able to do something.”

Erica Bradley, of Reno, Nevada, said she stopped shopping at Target because of their changing DEI policies.

“I don’t plan on going there ever again, just because I feel like they’ve shown that they’re not really committed to these things,” Bradley said. “They’ve lost my trust.”

For many consumers, the shift away from the big companies has revealed how much they have come to rely on them. As of last spring, 75% of American consumers had Amazon Prime memberships, a total of 180m Prime accounts, according to Bloomberg.

Bedson said cancelling her account made her aware of a culture of consumerism in American where “in some ways, it feels like we don’t have a choice”.

“Amazon is so convenient,” she said. “I think we all have become very complacent or complicit, and it’s hard to make these changes. But on the other hand, what else can we do?”

It’s been a year since Bradley cancelled her Prime account, after she saw Amazon’s union busting. She recalls a transition period as she was adjusting to life without Prime, but it ultimately led her to spend less overall.

“I just decided I don’t really need a lot of these things. Like I don’t need more clothes, I don’t really need more house decorations, which are things I used to spend a lot of money on,” Bradley said. “It’s not retail therapy anymore.”

The Harris poll found that a third of Americans are similarly trying to “opt out” of the economy, cutting down on overall spending as the political stances of corporations have become murky.

“It’s like a Whac-a-Mole now,” Wohlenhaus said. “You could really look in any direction and find something you dislike about the way corporations are caving to this administration.”

Wohlenhaus said she has started to prioritize shopping at local businesses. She kept her Costco membership, since the company affirmed its DEI policies.

During Joe Biden’s presidency, many of the boycotts against companies actually came from conservatives who felt corporations were caving to a “woke” mob. But boycotts didn’t amount to any serious consequences – with two exceptions. Bud Light saw a drop in sales after it sponsored a post by a transgender influencer and Target removed some of its Pride merchandise after conservative backlash.

It’s unclear what the consequences of the current backlash will be. But Wohlenhaus and others voiced optimism that consumers are thinking critically about the choices they’re making at checkout.

“Hopefully if thousands of other families are doing what we’re doing, I think they’ll start to feel it,” she said. “We don’t care about your products as much as we care about those values that we cherish.”

A journey through the hyper-political world of microchips,['Helen Sullivan'],2025-02-28,"A small town in the Netherlands hosts the only factory that produces the only chip-making machines that generate a type of light found nowhere naturally on Earth: extreme ultraviolet, a light emitted by young stars in outer space.

This light, known as EUV, is the only way to make one of the world’s most valuable and important technologies at scale: cutting-edge semiconductor chips. The factory is forbidden from selling its EUV machines to China.

Below we explain how the chips are made, why they have become the focus of the US-China trade wars, how Taiwan was drawn into the maelstrom, and what could come next. The answers take us from deep underground to outer space, from the dirtiest places in the world to the cleanest, from the hottest temperatures to the coldest, from man-made structures smaller than a virus to equipment so large it takes three planes to move, and finally, to a state in physics that is two opposites at the same time.

How are they made? Chips are made up of layers of thin, flat pieces of silicon – called wafers – that hold electric circuits. These circuits are comprised of billions of switches called transistors. Highly complex, powerful chips containing these networks of transistors are commonly referred to as semiconductors. If you want to make semiconductors, you’ll need $380m. This is the cost of the latest EUV machine from Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML). Shipping is a nightmare: the machine is so large and so delicate that it requires 40 freight containers, three cargo planes and 20 trucks to transport it from the Dutch factory in Veldhoven. All this to create and focus light with wavelengths almost as short as X-rays, with enough energy to penetrate solid objects. Chipmakers strive to meet a prediction called Moore’s law: that capacity – or the number of transistors on a chip – tends to double every two years. If chips are to stay the same size, and ideally get smaller, this means that transistors must be ever finer. ASML’s machine carves the patterns into the silicon wafers that hold the transistors. The finer the patterns, the more computing power you can pack on to a chip. Marc Assinck, a company spokesperson, likens light wavelengths to the thickness of a pen stroke. The more detail you want on a page, the thinner your pen should be. EUV light has a wavelength so narrow that it is invisible to the human eye and passes right through most materials. The light is produced by firing a laser at microscopic balls of tin. The tin evaporates into plasma, and the plasma emits light, which is moved through the lithography machine, hitting specially made mirrors. The light is shone through a “mask”, which is the pattern of one layer of a chip, on to the wafer. The area exposed to light hardens and the area not exposed is dissolved in a chemical solution, leaving behind a 3D pattern. Think of a chip like a building with 100 floors. Each building takes four months to produce, and each floor has its own layout, only the features of this layout can be just 25 nanometres: smaller than particles of influenza viruses, which are about 100 nanometres. EUV and other lithography machines carve the patterns of these layers, one by one. The machines aren’t easy to make. Like chips themselves, they’re assembled in dust-free rooms, the cleanest spaces on earth. Chips function at the level of atoms: a single speck of dust can render them useless. View image in fullscreen Illustration showing semiconductor chip structure. Illustration: ASML

Why is Taiwan so important? ASML makes the machines that make chips, but it doesn’t make the chips themselves. That is done, chiefly, by another remarkable company with another unremarkable name: TSMC, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which produces nine in every 10 of the world’s most advanced semiconductors – including those that power iPhones. Because Taiwan makes and supplies so many of the US’s semiconductor chips, the US has an added interest in protecting Taiwan amid concerns that China will invade. How Taiwan secured semiconductor supremacy – and why it won’t give it up Read more In 2022, the US convinced the Dutch government to place export controls on ASML’s machines, restricting their sale to China. To date, ASML says, no EUV lithography machines have been shipped to China, which means that unless – or until – it invents its own EUV lithography machines, China will be working with technology a few years older, and less powerful, than that of western countries – deep ultraviolet lithography, for example, instead of extreme ultraviolet. These machines can still produce very complex chips at scale – just not as complex. Artificial intelligence, another technology in which the US and China are fiercely competing to advance, relies on among the world’s most complex and powerful semiconductor chips. The leading designer of these chips is an American company called Nvidia. Its chips are produced by TSMC on machines made by ASML. China’s lack of access to EUV lithography explains why the debut of the Chinese chatbot DeepSeek came as such a shock to markets. A Chinese company produced a product as powerful as Chat GPT with less advanced – cheaper – technology. DeepSeek claims that it cost just $6m to train, compared with the billions of dollars spent by US companies to do the same thing. “The US believes that AI will be a transformative technology, impacting nearly every sector of the economy,” says Chris Miller, the author of Chip War: the Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology. “So it doesn’t want China to gain an advantage.” It is also crucial for defence and intelligence. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army has made “significant progress” in its efforts to use AI in combat in recent years, according to the Centre for Security and Emerging Technology. But not everyone believes that China’s access to ASML’s machines should be restricted, including ASML. Asked at a Bloomberg conference in October how much the restrictions were really about security threats, its CEO, Christophe Fouquet, said: “More and more people are asking themselves this exact question … Is it really about national security?” The debate might not need to continue for long: in 2024, Chinese company Shanghai Micro Electronics Company (SMIC) revealed that, a year earlier, it had filed a patent for an EUV lithography machine.

Where do rare earths come in? China boasts other advantages over western countries in the race to produce chips. In addition to silicon, semiconductors require so-called “rare earths” – in particular, germanium and gallium. By 2030, Gallium demand is projected to increase more than 350% from 2015 levels. Germanium demand is expected to double over the same period. China produces 98% of the world’s raw gallium, and more than two-thirds of the world’s raw germanium. This is one reason why Donald Trump is pressuring Ukraine into handing over its rare earths in exchange for aid, and why, after Trump’s first meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, the pair announced they had agreed to launch “a recovery and processing initiative” for rare earths.

"Donald Trump’s body language uncovered: ‘If you’re the silverback, you stand proud’",['Zoe Williams'],2025-02-28,"As Keir Starmer handed Donald Trump his unprecedented invitation from King Charles – a second state visit – he grasped the US president chummily by the shoulder, more than once.

Starmer was skating a tricky line, between matey familiarity and patronising reassurance, which must have been tutored, as he’s not a tactile man. Trump’s body language looked completely untaught, because nobody could teach this. The man has always been incredibly idiosyncratic.

He has his hands pointed downwards in what experts of non-verbal communication call “the steeple”, for obvious reasons. Yet, as Joe Navarro, the former FBI agent and author of (most recently) The Dictionary of Body Language, told me: “This is not uncommon, Elon Musk does it, Angela Merkel did it – but they tend to put them very high, utterly confident. Here you have the president’s, which is a modified steeple, where he loses its strength by pointing it downward.” It’s a gesture he often makes with world leaders – exactly the same image exists with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, except the Ukrainian president looks more annoyed – and it’s far from the only cue that he’s unsure or uncomfortable.

But how does that work? Because Trump, famously, loves trying to dominate with his body language. Images abound of him and Macron practically wrestling, in their efforts to outgrip each other. “We saw this in the first term,” Navarro continues, “when he was shaking hands with the [Shinzo Abe], the tight handshake, the pulling behaviours Trump has some awkward exchanges with the Japanese prime minister.

“It reminds me of some of the garbage that was being peddled about establishing dominance in the 1980s. You’ll be superior if you squeeze tight, or if your hand is on top, or if you bring them closer to your chest. There is nothing either empirical or scientific that says that playing hand jiu-jitsu makes the other person respect you more. What it does do, particularly in cultures that are context rich, it makes you look amateurish.”

The two world leaders engaged in a 19-second handshake that didn’t appear to end well.

Trump also has a repertoire of disdainful or disgusted facial gestures – he purses his lips tightly if he hears anything he dislikes, his commissure (the side of the mouth) pinches dramatically, which is usually a look of contempt. “He immediately reflects with his face exactly what he feels,” Navarro says, “And that’s quite a New York style – Brooklyn or Queens. You wouldn’t see that in middle America, people are more reserved in their expression.”

Other gestures that have played badly in a context-rich environment include holding Theresa May’s hand and walking ahead of the Queen – “That’s not a little faux pas, that’s a major faux pas,” Navarro says, but interprets those as “klutzy” rather than calculated to dominate.

The president has a number of contradictorily vulnerable behaviours. “In pictures in the White House, or when he’s surrounded by people, he crosses his arms very tight around himself, and that is a comforting behaviour. It’s literally a self-hug. And yet when we see him on The Apprentice, he never did that. You normally don’t expect leaders to be self-hugging. You expect them to have expansive behaviours,” Navarro says.

All of which pales in significance besides a picture of Trump and the Russian president. “Look at the arm swing on Putin versus the very stoic, demure, arms at the side, head low behaviours of Trump,” Navarro says. “I could hardly believe my eyes. It matters. We are primates. We evolved from primates. You don’t have to be told who the leader is. If you’re the silverback, you stand proud, you stand tall, you have the behaviours of confidence. That is nowhere to be seen with Trump.”

Dr Nicholas Newton-Fisher, a primate behavioural ecologist at the University of Kent, counsels that we should not only see our evolutionary similarity to chimps in terms of power play, they also “do a lot of subtle touching but these gestures tend to be affiliative or reassuring, or seeking reassurance, and you see commonalities here with humans”.

In the press conference with Starmer, a reporter asked the US president if British troops were attacked by Russian forces while in Ukraine, Starmer could count on the US’s support. Trump replied that the British were incredible fighters and could take care of themselves, relenting in a generalised way that he would “always stand with the British”, accompanied by a little spontaneous hand-hold, coming from underneath, that took Starmer by surprise.

It was not dominant but nor was it what you’d call reassuring."
"Gracie Abrams, the year’s biggest pop star: ‘Trump has only been in office a month, and everybody is more at risk’",['Alexis Petridis'],2025-02-28,"On a video call from a hotel room in Hamburg, Gracie Abrams is expounding on the virtues of decoupling yourself from social media and living a life offline. “You can literally do so much when you’re not scrolling!” she enthuses. “You can retain more information; everything gets lighter. You have a greater capacity to be more present, to be there for the people in your life, to read a book that’s going to inspire your next album, or go on a hike and breathe air instead of sitting in a dark room on fucking Instagram. I’m doing lots of, like, tactile stuff, staying off social media,” she adds. “Needlepoint and shit like that. I’m just trying to make things … to have some tangible evidence of having lived this year.”

Of course, this is nothing the world hasn’t heard before: we’re well used to being told about the benefits of a digital detox. Still, it feels like an intriguing statement coming from Gracie Abrams. For one thing, her single That’s So True spent most of January at No 1 in the UK: it spent most of November and December there as well, took a brief Christmas holiday, then reappeared to beat Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga et al once more. Her album The Secret of Us also reached No 1, and is now enjoying its 18th consecutive week in the Top 20, the kind of longevity only afforded to those artists who have broken through into the upper echelons of pop stardom.

It’s the same story back home in the US, where The Secret of Us has spent 35 weeks on the charts: her previous album managed two. Abrams is calling from Hamburg because it’s the latest stop on a global tour that’s been filling vast arenas for months and is scheduled to keep doing so until August. You see what she means about needlepoint, but you do wonder how much tangible evidence of having lived this year a person might need.

Even by latterday pop standards, her rise seems particularly bound up with social media. She first broke through in 2020, with I Miss You, I’m Sorry: a viral lockdown hit with its cheerfully amateurish, bedroom-bound video and lyrics that seemed to fit the prevalent mood (“Do you remember happy together? I do, don’t you?”). She already had a major label deal, but was initially famed for directly interacting with her audience online: responding to their comments on SoundCloud and Instagram, sending them DMs, referring to them not as her fans but her “friends” (“more friends than anyone has ever had ever!” she told an interviewer in 2021); becoming the first non-Korean artist to use Weverse, the K-pop platform designed to offer “a deeper level” of artist-fan interaction than that of traditional social media.

It’s a smart way to build a committed fanbase, and it played into a pervasive idea of Abrams as what one writer called “gen Z’s most unfiltered storyteller”: a singer-songwriter whose work was essentially private diary entries set to music, and who whispered her lyrics as if personally confiding in the listener.

But it’s clearly not an approach one can maintain after the kind of success garnered by The Secret of Us, an album noticeably brighter and less introverted than her previous work (the result, she says, of both “a crush that I had felt way more significantly than in previous years” and a new writing partnership with her best friend and roommate, Audrey Hobert). When you’re packing out the Alsterdorfer Sportshalle and Madison Square Garden, not everyone online wants to be your friend.

“It’s definitely not halted full stop,” she says. “There are moments where I do feel really thrilled to interact directly; whether it’s through a DM or a comment, I feel tapped into their lives still.” But, she says, it’s “less frequent, because, honestly, mentally I don’t benefit from engaging heavily in the way I used to. The way the algorithm works, if you spend five extra seconds reading a comment and there’s a keyword with your name in it, that’s what it starts to feed you. So I’d open my phone in the morning and there would be lots of unsolicited opinions that were starting to make me feel sore, and then I would notice myself carrying that feeling. But if you don’t engage with it, you don’t feel so sick.”

Being tapped into your audiences’ lives seems risky in an era when we hear a lot about toxic fandoms, when artists such as Chappell Roan feel compelled to call out fans for “creepy behaviour” and “harassment”.

“The very large majority of the time I have been lucky, my interactions with fans out in the world haven’t been ones that make me go ‘oh shit’,” she says. “But I’ve definitely had moments like that. I’m walking with my headphones in, or my back is turned, or my head is down and a stranger comes in with a hug before anything else … that’s really not a good feeling. As an animal, you’re just like, ‘Oh fuck, what’s that?’ Ninety per cent of the time it’s really sweet introductions, or no crossing any lines with physical touch. But if you experience it even once, your guard can go up, because it feels unnatural. You want to walk a fine line between being attuned to what your audience feels and letting your own conviction guide you.”

The occasional over-familiar fan aside, Abrams’ rise appears to have been remarkably smooth. Big names have flocked to work with her: The Secret of Us, like its predecessor Good Riddance, was made with the National’s Aaron Dessner, best-known as Taylor Swift’s chief latterday collaborator; Brian Eno unexpectedly cropped up on one track from Good Riddance. She has enjoyed a succession of profile-boosting celebrity co-signs. No sooner had I Miss You, I’m Sorry appeared than Olivia Rodrigo announced that her forthcoming single was inspired by it – the forthcoming single turned out to be themulti-bn streaming Drivers License – while Taylor Swift selected her as the support act on two sizeable chunks of the record-breaking Eras tour and appears as a guest and co-writer on The Secret of Us. Abrams recently posted a photo of herself embracing her idol, Joni Mitchell, who was apparently unfazed even when Abrams showed her a tattoo she has featuring Mitchell’s handwritten lyrics.

She has pulled off the enviable trick of establishing a fanbase who feel her songs confide her innermost secrets to them, while also drawing a veil over her private life, only ever discussing it publicly in the vaguest terms (she is presumed to be in a relationship with actor Paul Mescal, but has never confirmed it to the wider world). “Sharing versus not sharing,” she nods. “I’m lucky to have this avenue, where, in my songs, I talk very openly about how I feel. It’s like when I’m writing, I’m talking to myself. Talking to strangers, there are naturally things you hope to protect a bit more. Some things feel sacred.”

She seems smart, thoughtful and level-headed: at 25, she appears to be navigating the choppy waters of celebrity with admirable ease. This might have something to do with her background: her father is the Hollywood director/producer JJ Abrams. On the one hand, that means her success has played out to a constant background hum of sniping in which the phrase “nepo baby” figures heavily, but there are presumably worse preparations for fame than growing up in a celebrity-adjacent Hollywood family.

Quite the opposite, she says: she was so introverted as a teenager that she thought a “public-facing career” was out of the question. “I knew that it would involve performing, and that was the part that felt so horrifying to me. I wrote songs because it was easier than talking about my feelings. I wasn’t interested in anybody hearing me. I was so turned off by the idea of confronting people face-to-face. That was what I loved about sharing music online – you could hide behind a profile.”

As her major label courted her, she kept her fears hidden. “I remember signing my deal and feeling really nauseous about it.” So what changed? “Well, I see a therapist. And it hasn’t been some overnight thing. The first shows I ever played were over Zoom during the pandemic, so that was like a baby step versus truly facing my fear head-on. Then I played the tiniest rooms” – which, it should be noted, didn’t stop her “projectile vomiting” before going onstage – “so it’s almost like these tiny moments of exposure therapy.”

Trump has already done everything in his power to make us feel powerless and hopeless

Clearly it worked: you don’t see much evidence of introversion in the fan videos of her onstage, belting out I Miss You, I’m Sorry from a set designed to look like the bedroom in which she recorded the song’s original video, or lecturing audiences in a pre-election US about the necessity of voting when “democracy is hanging by a thread”. She was an ardent Harris supporter, and performed at one of her campaign rallies in Wisconsin.

In the wake of the US election result, one theory that did the rounds was that the sheer wattage of celebrity endorsements Harris received was counterproductive – that they reinforced the notion that the Harris campaign was out of touch with ordinary voters’ concerns in a difficult economic climate. “I don’t think it was counterproductive,” Abrams frowns. “The issues were so much deeper, more systemic. How I feel about having played a tiny role in one of her many rallies that she crushed flawlessly every single time is that I’m proud to have been there and proud to have felt that energy in the room. That was so tangible and so real, and it’s something I’ve held on to since the results of the election.

“Trump has only been in office for a month and has already done everything in his power to make every marginalised community feel smaller, to make everybody more at risk, to overwhelm us with information, or disinformation, so that we feel powerless and hopeless. And what I felt at that rally in Wisconsin that day was the opposite of hopelessness: I felt real strength in gathering. That’s the antidote right now. Obviously, there’s got to be so much more we do when we gather in that way. But I feel really lucky to have witnessed in person what that kind of light feels like, especially now in the face of this quality of darkness. It’s unprecedented, it’s global.”

She was so crushed by Trump’s victory that she wondered about going on tour at all. “Right before going off, I was just like: how are we not all dedicating all of our time to fighting this … thing?” She decided that “if me, Gracie, in the position I’m in in this world – like the luckiest ever – is feeling this way, then everybody is feeling this fucking way. I can give people who are coming to these shows two hours to feel everything they’re feeling at an extreme, and be able to express it, or just distract themselves for two hours and recharge their battery. We’re going to have to work out how to do that every single day, not just for the next four years, because obviously the impact of the next four years is going to be long-lasting.”

She says she spent a week at Dessner’s studio before departing for Europe to work on new material, and found herself writing noticeably different kinds of songs than she expected. “I was just like: shit, I don’t even know how to articulate the degree to which I feel sick inside about everything. Most of those songs from that week are not about relationships. They’re about the fact that LA just burned down, about the fact that I don’t understand how we’re supposed to really carry on. Of course those subjects will show up, it’s life, but they’re … different themes than I anticipated.”

But then, as she points out, nothing has turned out like she expected. “After signing and starting to release music in a more real way, and after playing my first shows and realising I was wrong about how I felt about playing live because of the kindness of the people in the room, I started writing long letters to myself about dreams,” she says. “One of the things I wrote after my first show was ‘One day I want to open for Taylor Swift’. That was never going to happen, obviously. What’s been so lucky is that the goalposts keep kind of moving and my imagination has expanded and I feel excited about being out of my comfort zone.

“Being proved wrong about what was the scariest thing in the world to me at the time has made me really excited to be wrong about everything else.” She laughs, before heading off to another packed arena."
"‘This moment is medieval’: Jackson Katz on misogyny, the manosphere – and why men must oppose Trumpism",['Ammar Kalia'],2025-02-28,"‘If it takes a village to raise a child, it also takes a village to raise a rapist,” Jackson Katz says. “Perpetrators aren’t individual monsters; they are people reflecting a system. We need to address that system.”

For the past 40 years, the researcher and activist has been advocating that violence against women be treated as a men’s issue. He works across the US in universities, schools and the military to encourage men to speak up when they encounter misogynistic behaviour in their peer groups. Katz believes that it is only through boys and men holding themselves accountable for their behaviour that violence against women can end. Since the re-election of Donald Trump, he believes his work has become more urgent than ever.

“The election has been a complete catastrophe – it was a huge setback for the prevention of domestic abuse and violence,” Katz, 60, says from the book-lined study of his home in Massachusetts. “Seventy-seven million Americans voted for Trump after he was found liable for sexual abuse in Manhattan and ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages. The jury’s verdict is undeniable. By voting for someone with that history, it has a normalising effect on his behaviour. It’s unleashed a firehose of misogyny.”

The consequences have included funding cuts for gender-based work and an attack on the mandate set out in the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. “Trump and Elon Musk’s Doge [Department of Government Efficiency] team is freezing funding for swathes of non-profits, including many of those that should be protected by the Violence Against Women Act,” he says. “They’re getting rid of DEI [diversity, equality and inclusion] initiatives and anything with the keyword ‘woman’ is coming under scrutiny. People who work in the area are stunned and despairing. This isn’t a normal moment – it is medieval and a huge rollback of progress.”

It’s our moral, ethical and human duty to help women in this struggle together

Katz has also witnessed a louder and more forceful chorus of young men promoting misogynistic ideals; online, he is often called a “virtue-signalling cuck” or a “beta male”. “There’s an assumption that young people are more left-leaning, but we are seeing the opposite right now and it’s very worrying,” he says, referencing the fact that 56% of 18- to 29-year-old male voters supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election, compared with 40% of women in that bracket.

“We’re witnessing a global backlash against women’s progress, since the past 50 years have seen unbelievable challenges to patriarchal norms. Trumpism and rightwing populism isn’t a revolt against the ‘elites’; it’s a reaction to men being de-centred and a backlash against feminism. Trump has been marketing himself with the men’s movement and it’s fuelled the manosphere from being an abusive men’s rights subculture to becoming the mainstream. We on the other side need a bigger microphone to get into the conversation – we each need to stand up and say ‘not in my name’, since people like Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson [who has argued that ‘the masculine spirit is under assault’ and that the patriarchy ‘might be predicated on competence’] have platforms with millions of followers being indoctrinated.”

Driven by that mission to reach a wider audience, Katz has written a book, Every Man: Why Violence Against Women Is a Men’s Issue, which outlines the ways that men can and should involve themselves in the fight against gender-based violence. He believes it may be the first time a major commercial publisher has released a book about men’s violence against women that has been written by a man. “It’s shocking to me, because you can go as far back as John Stuart Mill writing a critique of marital rape in 1869 to see how men have been talking about the issue,” Katz says. “We have been doing this work for a long time and the book is a toolkit for other men to get themselves involved. It’s our moral, ethical and human duty to help women in this struggle together.”

Katz was born in a small town north of Boston in 1960. He says he was brought up in a “jockocracy”, where social life and status revolved around American football and basketball. His biological father was a second world war medic and medical sociology professor who died while Katz’s mother was pregnant with Katz. Her second husband, the man Katz grew up with, was a blue-collar factory worker and truck driver: “A very tough, old-school guy who wasn’t very communicative,” Katz says.

In high school, Katz became a star football player and was celebrated in his parochial, male-dominated culture. He describes witnessing “generalised misogyny” as a teenager, but it wasn’t until he went to college at the University of Massachusetts Amherst that he began to learn the extent and pervasiveness of the problems faced by women and marginalised people.

“It was the 70s and my mind was expanding on issues of racism, sexual assault and the women’s movement. I found it all so interesting,” he says. “I started seeing how gender was one of the primary organisers of our society and, as I developed an interest in changing the world around me, it felt like the issues with gender needed to be addressed first. I was enjoying such freedom as a young man, walking home drunk late at night and not worrying about myself while my female hallmates were always thinking of their safety.”

Katz’s columns for the student newspaper became increasingly concerned with sexism and the Reclaim the Night protests that were occurring across campus. “I was inspired by these women who were standing up for their rights and safety,” he says. “That’s when I decided to speak out, too. It was as simple as that.”

Katz signed up for gender studies classes and eventually became the first man in the history of his college to minor in women’s studies. After graduating, he began working in grassroots gender campaigning, founding the anti-sexist men’s group Real Men in 1988.

Was it really simply attending college classes and protests that turned Katz from his working-class, sports-dominated male culture towards feminist campaigning? “I get asked all the time if something has happened to me to set me on this path. I have women close to me who have been assaulted by men, but it’s not just a personal experience,” he says.

“I took those classes because I wanted to learn how to have better relationships with the people around me and in the process I realised how gender-based violence affects everyone. Violence begets violence and the same system that produces men who abuse women produces men who abuse men. I came from a position of influence as a straight, white man and sportsperson, so I felt I had to speak up to try to break the cycle.”

What did his peers think about his shift into activism? “Mainly people thought I was a little weird,” he says, laughing. “But they couldn’t write me off, because I had been part of their culture and that was the key. They knew me, so in some way they had to listen.”

Attempting to change the culture from within became a tenet of Katz’s work with Real Men and, later, with his Mentors in Violence Prevention programme. Enlisting role models from professional sports and the military, Katz began running workshops and training programmes to encourage changes in behaviour from the top down in male-dominated organisations.

“I’ve long been convinced that lots of men are uncomfortable about their peers’ behaviour, but are scared of speaking out because of losing social status or facing retribution,” he says. “By getting role models talking about it, especially people like male athletes, who have a higher status, we can make other men feel comfortable to speak out when they see or hear something sexist, as well as bring these ideas to men who might never have considered their role in gender-based violence before.”

If we think about how we might be perpetuating a culture that produces rapists, it forces a level of introspection that makes people very uncomfortable

Gaining the ability and confidence to interrupt sexist behaviour from men is the main purpose of Katz’s book. Written in a conversational, largely jargon-free tone, it is intended as a practical toolkit for men to think about ways in which they can challenge difficult behaviour, with each chapter ending with a section on “how you can make a difference” that outlines lines of argument and conversation. Katz covers the history of men’s work in this space from the 1970s onwards, arguments against victim-blaming and men’s defensiveness when it comes to taking responsibility; he advocates against watching pornography, an industry that he says “legitimises misogynist abuse by normalising sexualised brutality”. He ends by analysing the “manosphere” and online groups that are influencing schoolchildren to support outspoken misogynists such as Tate.

A “how to” book tackling an issue as entrenched and systematic as gender-based violence may seem a futile response, but amid the guidance Katz lays out a strong argument often accompanied by shocking statistics. He refers to the World Health Organization statistic that almost one-third of girls and women aged 15 to 49 have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner, while one in seven children have lived with domestic abuse.

“It’s much more comforting to see the people committing these acts as monsters. We can dissociate ourselves from them, then we don’t have to be introspective,” Katz says. “It’s easier if rape is a pathological behaviour, but if we think about how we might be perpetuating a culture that produces rapists, it forces a level of introspection that makes people very uncomfortable. That introspection leads to action and choices about how we can change our lives.”

One method that Katz has helped pioneer in his career is the bystander approach – initially employed as a tactic against school bullying, where peers are encouraged to step in and support the bullied child, rather than leaving the onus of responsibility solely on their shoulders.

Katz began running workshop scenarios where men would think through their ethical obligations when faced with sexist or potentially abusive behaviour by one of their group. “Men would walk in with their arms folded, saying they didn’t need to be there because they weren’t abusers, so I would say: ‘You don’t abuse girls or women, but what are you doing to help others who are abusing them?’” Katz says.

“It’s leadership training, since it takes nothing to be one of the boys, but it takes courage to stand up for what is right. It can be scary, relationally and physically, to challenge someone, and people push back when you upend the status quo, but your silence is telling them that it’s OK. Those men would walk out with their minds changed. I want it to be required training across the board, from schools to colleges, sports teams, workplaces and beyond.”

Since there are almost 400 million guns in circulation in the US, Katz emphasises that his approach is not to engage in potentially dangerous public interventions, but rather to focus on “known peer cultures” like friends, teammates and co-workers. “People don’t speak in those situations, because of social fear, but by framing the guy who speaks up as a strong man, or a good friend, you’re making it positive and aspirational, which has more likelihood of success,” he says. “The most important aspect is making sure those in positions of power speak up the loudest and that our leaders are confronting the issues, too, as that is where widespread change can happen.”

With the most powerful political leader in the world in the process of opposing much of what Katz advocates, he emphasises the need for persistence and bravery from bystanding men – a show of leadership in the absence of a leader. “We can’t tell boys that bullying is bad and then equally reward bullies like Trump in power,” Katz says. “There’s a lot of fear in the face of a rightwing populist government, but we need men to loudly oppose him, otherwise real people will be harmed. We’re living in a different world now and it’s urgent.”

As the father of a grownup son, Katz says his main responsibility is to be a role model for young people and to provide a platform for their voices. “We owe it to the next generation of boys and girls, who haven’t chosen to be born into this patriarchal society,” he says. “Challenge your peer groups, educate each other and make sure your voice is louder than those spreading abusive norms. It takes courage, but it will only cause more tragedy if we don’t show it.”

‘I was causing harm’: author Helen Jukes on motherhood and our polluted bodies,['Maya Goodfellow'],2025-02-27,"When Helen Jukes told her friends she was writing about motherhood and pollution, they advised her against it and warned she might make pregnant people more anxious than they already were. But she disagreed. Mother Animal, a personal account of Jukes’ pregnancy and early years of motherhood, details her growing realisation of how contaminated her body, and her baby, have become. And it’s something she thinks all would-be parents should be more aware of. There are chemicals from human industry in breast milk, amniotic fluid and bones, she writes. Toxicologists have found “forever chemicals” in embryos and foetuses at “every stage of pregnancy … in lung tissues, in livers”. It is inescapable.

Yet it is spoken about far too little. “I find it quite disrespectful to think that mothers wouldn’t be capable of handling [this] information,” she says when we meet at her home on the edge of the Peak District.

Around the time she got pregnant, Jukes actively wanted to know what kind of world she was bringing her child into, reading, for example, David Wallace-Wells’ The Uninhabitable Earth, about the scale of the climate crisis and how devastating its effects are and will become. But it wasn‘t until she had her daughter that she realised how much she had missed; how much pregnancy and breastfeeding manuals had left out. “I did not learn about the human studies that found that high exposure to forever chemicals was significantly related to early undesired weaning, or not initiating breastfeeding at all – or that they might be present in the makeup I applied to my skin, and the waterproof coating on my raincoat and the stain resistant fabric on my sofa,” she explains in the book.

It’s the disbelief at all she didn’t hear about that seems to drive forward her research and writing, which moves between a wild, controlled anger that is so intimately conveyed you feel you’re in it with her and an unceasing determination to understand the state of play.

Jukes says she took inspiration from Sandra Steingraber’s, ​​Having Faith: An Ecologist’s Journey to Motherhood, which looks at the environmental hazards in pregnancy, and Lucy Cooke’s Bitch: A Revolutionary Guide to Sex, Evolution and the Female Animal, which paints a picture of different animals’ sexual identities and sexualities to challenge gender stereotypes. She also spoke to a lot of different experts, including a toxicologist who just so happens to be trying to have a baby. She asks the toxicologist an inevitable question: how does she hold motherhood and pollution in her mind at the same time? Her immediate answer is that she can’t; they have to remain separate. “In asking the question, I realised that I had been looking for reassurance: it’s not as bad as you think. But it is that bad,” Jukes writes.

If you look at her setup, Jukes’ life might seem miles away from all of this. She picks me up from a small train station not far from her house. It feels remote in comparison to London, where I’ve come from. The train station is deserted, it looks as if it has not long ago rained, the air feels fresh and you can see lush greenery all around. I imagine the peace you might find living nestled among the trees. I wonder if she feels this, having moved here from Oxford and before that London (there was also a brief stint in Italy and the Welsh borders). Leaving behind her job in the third sector, now she works amid this rolling countryside as a writer and a teacher of writing. But I’m reminded when we speak not to romanticise the natural world as a place of purity. Part of the book is about showing this view of nature as a con, she says, an image that’s created by culture.

Jukes is softly spoken and carefully weighs up her answers to my questions. But her frustration is still palpable, sitting in the living room of the former worker’s cottage she lives in with her daughter. What bothers her are the misconceptions around naturalness and motherhood. “I don’t think that had really landed for me before I became pregnant and suddenly I began to find some of the images and advertisements and the discourse [around pregnancy and breastfeeding] really horrifying,” she says. If the connection between mother, baby and contamination is mentioned at all, it’s chalked up to personal responsibility: avoid cigarette smoke, eat less seafood.

Mother Animal could have easily turned into a how-to book, and it isn’t difficult to imagine how popular a guide to parenting amid the pollution might be. But Jukes knows individualism is not the answer; making the right choice, even if it were possible, she says, assumes a level of information and financial capability not available to everyone.

Being a mother is not about creating a small environment where everything is safe, calm and pure, she explains. This doesn’t exist. Take feeding your baby. There is not comprehensive global data on the likely level of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (Pfas, also referred to as forever chemicals) in different peoples’ breast milk, with studies suggesting it varies internationally and domestically. If you are in an area of high exposure, for example through contaminated drinking water, some peoples’ breastmilk can have a huge amount of toxins in it. Another recent study of Dutch infants, found a higher level of daily intake of Pfas were influenced by, among other things, exclusively breastfed babies, maternal age and if it was the mother’s first-time breastfeeding. The other feeding option, formula, has problems too. One investigation found 85 chemical compounds defined as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which are chemicals that interfere with how hormones work, or suspected EDCs in different formula milks and containers, meaning individual low exposure to each substance. At the same time, polypropylene infant feeding bottles release high levels of microplastics, and it seems this increases when they’re exposed to sterilisation and high-water temperatures.

Owning up to her culpability was important for Jukes. “Yes, on the one hand I was feeling achingly kind of full of care,” she explains, “and on the other hand … I was causing harm.” She isn’t only referring to the chemical burden she was passing on to her child; she was bringing stuff into their home, throwing it in the bin and from there it was going to affect other creatures and other parts of the world too.

Nature, humans, other animals, she believes, are all intertwined. Jukes recounts taking some comfort in learning about the way other animals parent, detailing the wild complexity in how they care for their young in the book. She tells me about the caddis flies, whose larvae don’t have any parental care; they create cases for themselves out of flotsam they find in their environment. Or the Australian three-toed skink, which can have eggs and live young in the same litter. These accounts make moments of this urgent book joyful and expansive. “Who am I to say these simple creatures are not complex? The world is diverse and dynamic,” she says. “These creatures are amazing”.

But they are vulnerable too. There are pesticides in seabirds, flame retardants in humpback whales and industrial solvents in penguin eggs. Just like the pregnancy books, the research that she read about other animals parenting techniques often didn’t cover this part. “Mothering creatures evolve to fit the needs of their niche, but those niches are changing, and the extent to which the mothering creatures are able to adapt (rather than remain steady and unchanging) will be a key factor in determining which species survive into the future”, she writes.

With all that she knows, I wonder, how does she cope? How do you raise your child amid the toxicity, especially if you know you can’t control it all? She says we have to channel our energies into collective change. “We need to be writing to MPs,” she says. “We need to be making the case that these chemicals should not be circulated at all.”

By the time I get to the end of the book, it seems Jukes is not only railing against all the pollution we’ve created, she is also imagining how else we might have and raise children in this world.

In her first book A Honeybee Heart Has Five Openings, a meditative, personal reflection on beekeeping, we leave Jukes as she’s falling in love. In Mother Animal, we rejoin her when she’s embarking on motherhood, we assume with the same person. But over the course of the book, she subtly indicates that their relationship has broken down. It feels like she’s searching for a light in a storm; one of which might be all the animals who show mothering can be much more flexible than we realise.

Rare though it might be in the animal world, she writes about mother lions branching off from their prides to raise offspring together and emperor penguins putting their young together in a “communal creche” when they’re out hunting. Maybe we take this variety seriously. Maybe all the responsibility need not fall on the mother. Maybe we think of raising children collectively.

Despite this tentative hope, there is one part of Mother Animal I can’t stop thinking about. Jukes speaks to a veterinary epidemiologist in Edinburgh who led a necropsy on an orca, Lulu, who came from a population where there hadn’t been any offspring in 25 years. They found that Lulu had scar-like ovaries, which prevented her from having calves, and she had a level of polychlorinated biphenyls – a group of toxic chemicals used in paints, glue and other industrial products – in her body a hundred times over what is considered safe. These orcas may go extinct within our lifetime. In a world of such toxicity, a world where the climate and our natural world is in crisis, the epidemiologist admitted to Jukes that he’d chosen not to have children.

I ask her about this; how did she feel when he said this? She explains that she respects this decision, and understands why people make it. But for her, despite all she knows, all she has learned and all she has written, she maintains that we cannot just stop. “If we do”, she says, “they’re winning”."

"Joy, hope and murder in free Syria – podcast","['Michael Safi', 'Alex Atack', 'Tom Glasser', 'Homa Khaleeli']",2025-02-28,"After more than a decade of war, and half a century of repressive rule under Bashar al-Assad and his father, Syrians have a new ruler and a new future. Michael Safi spent a week travelling around the country, speaking to people about their surging hopes and joy – but also their fears of how fragile this peace could prove to be.

Driving from Lebanon to Damascus with a family, he heard about the painful toll the years of war and repression had taken on them: a father killed, a brother disappeared, a sister jailed. But they also told him how optimistic they still were for this moment of history.

In Damascus, he discovered normal life had begun creeping back – but that global jihadists were still manning checkpoints. And he spoke to an aid worker who said his British citizenship had been revoked and who could soon be a new Syrian national.

Outside the city, however, Michael found that the Alawites, Assad’s religious sect, were already facing bloody reprisals. But although many worry about what the new government of former jihadists might do, as one civil society activist told him: “Before the regime fell, we didn’t have space to move. Everything was really dark. Now we have much to do in our country and I’m seeing a space to move.”"
Is the tide starting to turn against Trump? – podcast,"['Jonathan Freedland', 'Stan Greenberg', 'Hattie Moir', 'Zoe Hitch']",2025-02-27,"This week, Donald Trump continued to dominate the world stage, welcoming a procession of global leaders to Washington, including Keir Starmer. But while the ‘special relationship’ is front and centre in the UK, attention in the US is very much elsewhere. As the president goes full steam ahead with his domestic agenda, there are warning signs for Trump in the polls. So, could he be in trouble at home? And how could the Democrats take advantage?

Jonathan Freedland speaks to Stanley Greenberg, the bestselling author, Democratic pollster and political strategist who played a crucial role in the elections of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair"

By studying polar bears they get a better understanding of what is happening in this part of the Arctic environment. The bears roam over large distances and, being apex predators, provide lots of information about what is happening lower in the food chain and across different Arctic species.

‘I visit and his face lights up’: caring for West Yorkshire’s ageing population – photo essay,['Graeme Robertson'],2025-02-28,"In the years I have worked for Age UK, I’ve found there is always more to do, always someone else to help, and even with double the staff we could only scratch the surface.

That said, it is an honour to share my days with so many lovely people who have great stories to tell, who have lived such varied lives. To me this is more than a job, it’s a vocation – and I plan to continue to do so as long as I am able.

Community Fund projects like ours are paid for by the national lottery. Our aim is to reduce loneliness and isolation by engaging with hard to reach people who might otherwise not be aware of the help and support we have to offer.

Covid really made us look deeper as a charity into the way we connect with our clients. From shopping to supporting with general information about the pandemic, we were there at the end of the phone – our volunteers really stepped up.

We soon realised that the level of fear and loss was overwhelming for some, and what they really needed was to talk it out. Some lost life partners in such circumstances where they were unable to meet family or friends, which meant they were unable to process the grief. Bereavement services were overwhelmed, leaving people to wait for months for someone to talk to. Out of this situation, we developed a service to provide low-level mental health and welfare support.

As soon as it was safe to do so, our Time for Teas programme was rolled out across the district meaning for the first time since lockdown we could offer people the opportunity to meet up in a socially distanced way. The relief among our clients was palpable. A common feeling was they would rather risk dying of Covid than spend any more time alone. Advanced age meant they felt it was better to enjoy what life they had left than to prolong the inevitable staying at home.

Many of our clients feel their needs should not be spoken of – they don’t want to cause a fuss. I often wonder if this is the last generation that will be accepting of what they are given, be that money, time or healthcare. There is a sense of pride, sometimes stubbornness, which makes them accept what little is offered. Having lived through rationing, some of them during the second world war, many have the mindset of not asking for more.

So many people say to us, “I don’t know what I would have done without you” or “you saved my life”. We have to catch as many as possible of those who fall through the net.

Molly Fox, 86 View image in fullscreen Molly Fox enjoys a cup of tea wrapped in a blanket

Molly lives alone – her family are on the other side of the world – which means she’s often lonely even though she has FaceTime calls with them regularly. She manages to get out on her mobility scooter and is well known around her home town. Molly, like many others, struggles to keep warm while keeping her bills affordable. Fear of debt means she wears a coat over her clothes, gloves, scarf and a hot-water bottle, and has hot drinks to keep warm in her lounge when she is alone. Pride and the habit of “living within your means” drives Molly to save money wherever she can.

Tom Owen, 91 View image in fullscreen

Tom is a veteran who we came into contact with about three years ago. He would attend our events with Marion, his wife, who was living with dementia. They were self-sufficient, not asking for any help.

But Marion recently died and now Tom is totally bereft after looking after his wife of almost 70 years. The love they shared shone through. Now, filling each day becomes a struggle; he can still hear her voice calling out in the night.

I visit him and his face lights up. As someone who knew Marion, he feels comfortable talking to me about her and how much he misses her. Loneliness is not always a visible condition, but it can have a dramatic impact on your wellbeing and your will to go on.
